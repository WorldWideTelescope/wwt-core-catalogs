spidery nebula is seen in the upper-centre of the image. Slightly to the
lower-right, a web of filaments harbours the famous supernova SN 1987A. Many
other reddish nebulae are visible in the image, as well as a cluster of young
stars on the left, known as NGC 2100. Technical information: the image is based
on observations carried out by Joao Alves (Calar Alto, Spain), Benoit Vandame
and Yuri Beletsky (ESO) with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) at the 2.2-m telescope
on La Silla. These data consist of a 2x2 WFI mosaic in the B- and V-bands, and
in the H-alpha and [OIII] narrow bands. The data were first processed with the
ESO/MVM pipeline by the Advanced Data Products (ADP) group at ESO. This image is
available as a mounted image in the ESOshop. #L

text> Image obtained with ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the spiral galaxy
observed by the European Commissioner for Science and Research, Janez Potocnik,
when at Paranal. NGC 134 is a barred spiral with its spiral arms loosely wrapped
around a bright, bar-shaped central region. The red features lounging along its
spiral arms are glowing clouds of hot gas in which stars are forming, so-called
HII regions. The galaxy also shows prominent dark lanes of dust across the disc,
obscuring part of the galaxy’s starlight. The image is a colour composite based
on data obtained in the B, V, R, and H- filters with the FORS2 instrument
attached to Antu, UT1 of the VLT. During his stay on Paranal, the Commissioner,
together with the observatory staff, prepared the observations of this Galaxy.
At night, Janez Potocnik initiated these observations, and checked the quality
of the images as they appeared on the control screens. Because the
high-sensitivity detectors used on the VLT measure only the intensity of the
light reaching their pixels, the colour information is acquired by taking a
sequence of images through different coloured filters. Consequently, the
Commissioner could not immediately see the attached image, but only
black-and-white version of it. The final colour processing was done by Haennes
Heyer and Henri Boffin, with input from Yuri Beletsky (all ESO).

text> Using ESO’s Very Large Telescope, an international team of astronomers has
discovered a stunning rare case of a triple merger of galaxies. This system,
which astronomers have dubbed ‘The Bird’ - although it also bears resemblance
with a cosmic Tinker Bell - is composed of two massive spiral galaxies and a
third irregular galaxy. In this image, a 30-min VLT/NACO K-band exposure has
been combined with archive HST/ACS B and I-band images to produce a three-colour
image of the ‘Bird’ interacting galaxy system. The NACO image has allowed
astronomers to not only see the two previously known galaxies, but to identify a
third, clearly separate component, an irregular, yet fairly massive galaxy that
seems to form stars at a frantic rate.

(top), 7174 (bottom right) and 7176 (bottom left), and located 106 million
light-years away towards the constellation of Piscis Austrinus (the ’southern
Fish’). This triplet of galaxies makes up part of the Hickson Compact Group HCG
90. NGC 7173 and 7176 are elliptical galaxies, while NGC 7174 is a spiral galaxy
with quite disturbed dust lanes and a long, twisted tail. This seems to indicate
that the two lower galaxies - whose combined shape bears some resemblance to
that of a sleeping baby - are currently interacting. Astronomers have suggested
that the three galaxies will finally merge. The size of the image is about 5.3
arcminutes. The image is based on data obtained with the VLT FORS1 instrument on
ESO’s Very Large Telescope through three different filters, B, V, and R. The
data were extracted from the ESO Science Archive and fully processed by Henri
Boffin (ESO).

text> The nebula around the Cepheid star RS Pup undoubtedly holds a wealth of
information about the mass-loss history of this star. It will thus be
instrumental to understand the evolution of Cepheids. Less than five years away
from the centenary of the discovery of the Period-Luminosity relation by Leavitt
& Pickering, RS Pup could well become a “Rosetta stone” for this important class
of stars. This colour composite image is based on observations made with the
3.6-m ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) installed at the La Silla Observatory
(Chile) and equipped with the ESO Multi-Mode Instrument (EMMI). The image is
based on data obtained through B, V, and R-filters. In order to avoid a heavy
saturation of the detector, RS Pup was positioned in the gap between the
detectors.

text> Part of a filament in the Corona Australis molecular cloud. The image is a
composite of J-, H-, and K-band near-infrared observations that were made with
the SOFI instrument on ESO’s NTT telescope in August 2006. The observations were
made to test, how easily the scattered light can be observed and how good it is
as a tracer of cloud structure. The J-, H-, and K-band intensities are coded
with blue, green, and red colours. The gradual saturation of the near-infrared
bands is visible as a change of colour. In diffuse regions the shorter
wavelength J-band is strong and the colour is bluish. When the J-band saturates
the colour changes first to green and finally, in the centre of the filament,
the red colour corresponding to the K-band becomes the strongest. In the most
saturated regions the surface brightness data can only be used to derive a lower
limit for the total amount of dust on the line of sight.

text> Using HARPS on the ESO 3.6-metre telescope at La Silla, astronomers were
able to study in great detail the star Iota Horologii, known to harbour a giant
planet, and make a very precise portrait of it: its temperature is 6150 K, its
mass is 1.25 times that of the Sun, and its age is 625 million years. Moreover,
the star is found to be more metal-rich than the Sun by about 50%. This means
the star must have drifted from the Hyades cluster where it formed.

text> This dramatic image of the galaxy Messier 83 was captured by the Wide
Field Imager at ESO’s La Silla Observatory, located high in the dry desert
mountains of the Chilean Atacama Desert. Messier 83 lies roughly 15 million
light-years away towards the huge southern constellation of Hydra (the sea
serpent). It stretches over 40 000 light-years, making it roughly 2.5 times
smaller than our own Milky Way. However, in some respects, Messier 83 is quite
similar to our own galaxy. Both the Milky Way and Messier 83 possess a bar
across their galactic nucleus, the dense spherical conglomeration of stars seen
at the centre of the galaxies.

text> This composite image shows the central regions of the nearby Circinus
galaxy, located about 12 million light years away. Data from NASA’s Chandra
X-ray Observatory is shown in blue and data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
telescope is shown in yellow (“I-band”), red (hydrogen emission), cyan
(“V-band”) and light blue (oxygen emission). The blue source near the lower
right hand corner of the image is the supernova SN 1996cr, that has finally been
identified over a decade after it exploded. The supernova was first singled out
in 2001 as a bright, variable object in a Chandra image, but it was not
confirmed as a supernova until years later, when clues from a spectrum obtained
with ESO’s Very Large Telescope led the team to start the real detective work of
searching through data from 18 different telescopes, both ground- and
space-based, nearly all of which was in the archives. SN 1996cr is one of the
nearest supernovae in the last 25 years.

text> This new portrait of the bright star-forming region NGC 346, in which
different wavelengths of light swirl together like watercolours, reveals new
information about how stars form. NGC 346 is located 210,000 light-years away in
the Small Magellanic Cloud, a neighbouring dwarf galaxy of the Milky Way. The
image is based on data from ESA XMM-Newton (X-rays; blue), ESO’s New Technology
Telescope (visible light; green), and NASA’s Spitzer (infrared; red). The
infrared light shows cold dust, while the visible light denotes glowing gas, and
the X-rays represent very hot gas. Ordinary stars appear as blue spots with
white centres, while young stars enshrouded in dust appear as red spots with
white centres.

collapse into dense clumps where new stars are then formed. The 870-micron
submillimetre-wavelength data were taken with the LABOCA camera on the 12-m

Note that because WFI is equipped with a mosaic detector, there are two small
gaps in the image which were filled with lower quality data from the Digitized

text> The Einstein Cross and the galaxy that causes this ‘cosmic mirage’, as
seen with the FORS instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope. This cross-shaped
configuration consists of four images of a single very distant source. The
multiple images are a result of gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy, an
effect that was predicted by Albert Einstein as a consequence of his theory of
general relativity. The light source in the Einstein Cross is a quasar
approximately ten billion light-years away, whereas the foreground lensing
galaxy is ten times closer. The light from the quasar is bent in its path and
magnified by the gravitational field of the lensing galaxy.

text> This colour-composite image of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) was created
from images obtained using the Wide Field Imager (WFI), an astronomical camera
attached to the 2.2-metre Max-Planck Society/ESO telescope at the La Silla
observatory in Chile. The blue-green glow in the centre of the Helix comes from
oxygen atoms shining under effects of the intense ultraviolet radiation of the
120 000 degree Celsius central star and the hot gas. Further out from the star
and beyond the ring of knots, the red colour from hydrogen and nitrogen is more
prominent. A careful look at the central part of this object reveals not only
the knots, but also many remote galaxies seen right through the thinly spread
glowing gas.This image was created from images through blue, green and red
filters and the total exposure times were 12 minutes, 9 minutes and 7 minutes
respectively. This image is available as a mounted image in the ESOshop. #L

48-inch Schmidt telescope as part of the Digitized Sky Survey 2. The giant
elliptical galaxy Messier 87 is seen in the centre, while Messier 84 and 86 are
the two bright galaxies forming part of the small group on the centre right of
the image. New observations obtained with ESO’s Very Large Telescope have shown
that the halo of stars around Messier 87 has been truncated, possibly because of
some interaction with Messier 84. The observations also reveal that Messier 87
and 86 are moving towards each other.

text> This image of the Arches Cluster of young, massive stars was obtained with
NACO on ESO’s Very Large Telescope. The field of view is 28 arcseconds. North is
up and east is to the left. This image is a composite of infrared images
obtained through J, H and K filters. The stars appear as bright cores surrounded
by faint diffuse halos. This is typical of images obtained by adaptive optics
instruments. The halo corresponds to light that was not fully corrected for the
blurring effects of the Earth’s atmosphere.

text> The turbulent central region of our Milky Way is shown in this beautiful
picture taken with the Wide Field Imager attached to the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO
telescope. Near the centre of the image — and of our Galaxy — a supermassive
black hole lurks (see ESO Press Release eso0846). Dense dust found there
obscures all but the brightest stars. The image also includes the area occupied
by the Arches Cluster (located in the middle of the upper quarter of the image).
Astronomers needed to look in the near-infrared with the acute eye offered by
adaptive optics on ESO’s Very Large Telescope to study the stellar composition
of the Arches Cluster. This crowded stellar factory has more than a thousand
stars crammed into each cubic light year — an astonishing one million times as
star-filled as our Sun’s neighbourhood (ESO Press Release eso0921). Also see the
marvellous zoom to the Arches Cluster. This colour composite image was made from
data taken with B, V, and Rc filters.

By studying this remnant in detail, a team of astronomers was able to solve the
mystery of the Milky Way’s super-efficient particle accelerators. The team shows
that the shock wave visible in this area is very efficient at accelerating
particles and the energy used in this process matches the number of cosmic rays
observed on Earth. North is toward the top right and east to the top left. The
image is about 6 arc minutes across.

text> This image, centred on the B[e] star HD 87643, beautifully shows the
extended nebula of gas and dust that reflects the light from the star. The
central star’s wind appears to have shaped the nebula, leaving bright, ragged
tendrils of gas and dust. A careful investigation of these features seems to
indicate that there are regular ejections of matter from the star every 15 to 50
years. The image, taken with the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre
telescope at La Silla, is based on data obtained through different filters: B, V
and R.

text> This image, showing a very rich field of stars towards the Carina arm of
the Milky Way, is centred on the star HD 87643, a member of the class of B[e]
stars. The amazing image is set ablaze by a flurry of stars of all colours and
brightnesses, some of which are seen against a backdrop of clouds of dust and
gas. The red emission nebula is RCW47 and was catalogued in 1960. HD 87643 has
been extensively studied with a full range of ESO telescopes, including the Very
Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Surrounded by a complex, extended nebula
that is the result of previous violent ejections, the star is shown to have a
companion. Interactions in this double system, surrounded by a dusty disc, may
be the engine fuelling the star’s remarkable nebula. The image, taken with the
Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla, is based on
data obtained through different filters: B, V and R. The field of view is 33 x
32 arc-minutes.

text> Colour composite image of the central part of the stellar cluster RCW 38,
around the young, massive star IRS2, taken with the NACO adaptive optics
instrument attached to ESO’s Very Large Telescope. Thanks to this image,
astronomers were able to discover that IRS2 is in fact a twin system composed of
two almost equally massive stars. The astronomers also found a handful of
protostars – the faintly luminous precursors to fully realised stars – and
dozens of other candidate stars that have eked out an existence here despite the
powerful ultraviolet light radiated by IRS2. The image is based on near-infrared
data taken through three different filters (J, H and K). The field of view is
about 1 arcminute across.

text> The dense star cluster RCW 38 glistens about 5,500 light years away in the
direction of the constellation Vela (the Sails). RCW 38 is an “embedded”
cluster, in that the nascent cloud of dust and gas still envelops its stars.
There, young, titanic stars bombard fledgling suns and planets with powerful
winds and large amount of light, helped in their devastating task by
short-lived, massive stars that explode as supernovae. In some cases, this
energetic onslaught cooks away the matter that may eventually form new planetary
systems. Scientists think that our own Solar System emerged from such a dramatic
environment. This image was obtained with the Wide Field Imager instrument on
the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla, using data collected through four
filters (B, V, R and H-alpha). The field of view is about 10 arcminutes.

text> Seen edge-on, observations of NGC 4945 suggest that this hive of stars is
a spiral galaxy much like our own Milky Way, with swirling, luminous arms and a
bar-shaped centre. Sites of active star formation, known as HII regions, are
seen prominently in the image, appearing bright pink. These resemblances aside,
NGC 4945 has a brighter centre that likely harbours a supermassive black hole,
which is devouring reams of matter and blasting energy out into space. NGC 4945
is about 13 million light-years away in the constellation of Centaurus (the
Centaur) and is beautifully revealed in this image taken with data in five bands
(B, V, R, H-alpha and S II) with the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla.

text> The second of three images of ESO’s GigaGalaxy Zoom project is a new and
wonderful 340-million-pixel vista of the central parts of our galactic home, a
34 by 20-degree wide image that provides us with a view as experienced by
amateur astronomers around the world. Taken by Stéphane Guisard, an ESO engineer
and world-renowned astrophotographer, from Cerro Paranal, home of ESO’s Very
Large Telescope, this second image directly benefits from the quality of
Paranal’s sky, one of the best on the planet. The image shows the region
spanning the sky from the constellation of Sagittarius (the Archer) to Scorpius
(the Scorpion). The very colourful Rho Ophiuchi and Antares region features
prominently to the right, as well as much darker areas, such as the Pipe and
Snake Nebulae. The dusty lane of our Milky Way runs obliquely through the image,
dotted with remarkable bright, reddish nebulae, such as the Lagoon and the
Trifid Nebulae, as well as NGC 6357 and NGC 6334. This dark lane also hosts the
very centre of our Galaxy, where a supermassive black hole is lurking. The image
was obtained by observing with a 10-cm Takahashi FSQ106Ed f/3.6 telescope and a
SBIG STL CCD camera, using a NJP160 mount. Images were collected through three
different filters (B, V and R) and then stitched together. This mosaic was
assembled from 52 different sky fields made from about 1200 individual images
totalling 200 hours exposure time, with the final image having a size of 24 403
x 13 973 pixels. Note that the final, full resolution image is only available
through Stéphane Guisard. #L

text> Astronomers obtained this portrait of Barnard’s Galaxy using the Wide
Field Imager attached to the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope at ESO’s La Silla
Observatory in northern Chile. Also known as NGC 6822, this dwarf irregular
galaxy is one of the Milky Way’s galactic neighbours. The dwarf galaxy has no
shortage of stellar splendour and pyrotechnics. Reddish nebulae in this image
reveal regions of active star formation, wherein young, hot stars heat up nearby
gas clouds. Also prominent in the upper left of this new image is a striking
bubble-shaped nebula. At the nebula’s centre, a clutch of massive, scorching
stars send waves of matter smashing into surrounding interstellar material,
generating a glowing structure that appears ring-like from our perspective.
Other similar ripples of heated matter thrown out by feisty young stars are
dotted across Barnard’s Galaxy. The image was made from data obtained through
four different filters (B, V, R, and H-alpha). The field of view is 35 x 34
arcmin.

stars, a solitary ruby-red supergiant and a variety of other brilliantly
coloured stars are visible in the image, as well as many much fainter ones,
often with intriguing colours. The huge variety in brightness exists because the
brighter stars are 15 to 20 times the mass of the Sun, while the dim points are
less than half the mass of the Sun. This is the first image of an open galactic
cluster with imaging extending from the far ultraviolet to the near-infrared.

Masayuki Tanaka from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), to uncover a
gigantic, previously unknown assembly of galaxies located almost seven billion
light-years away from us. This structure was confirmed by further observations
made using ESO’s Very Large Telescope and Subaru. It is the first observation of
such a prominent galaxy structure in the distant Universe, providing further
insight into the cosmic web and how it formed.

text> This image of the central parts of Centaurus A reveals the
parallelogram-shaped remains of a smaller galaxy that was gulped down about 200
to 700 million years ago. The image is based on data collected with the SOFI
instrument on ESO’s New Technology Telescope at La Silla. The original image,
obtained by observing in the near-infrared through three different filters (J, H
and K) was specially processed to look through the dust, providing a clear view
of the centre. The field of view is about 4 x 4 arcminutes.

text> Peering through the thick dust clouds of our galaxy’s central parts (the
“bulge”) with an amazing amount of detail, a team of astronomers has revealed an
unusual mix of stars in the stellar grouping known as Terzan 5. Never observed
anywhere in the bulge before, this peculiar cocktail of stars suggests that
Terzan 5 is in fact one of the bulge’s primordial building blocks, most likely
the relic of a dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way during its very early
days. This near-infrared image was obtained with the Multi-conjugate Adaptive
Optics Demonstrator (MAD) instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope. Observations
in two bands (J and K) were combined. The field of view is 40 arcseconds across.

text> This impressive image of the open cluster known as Trumpler 14 was
obtained with the Multi-conjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator (MAD) mounted on
ESO’s Very Large Telescope. The cluster, which is found to be only 500 000 years
old — a blink of an eye in the Universe’s history — resides at the outskirts of
the central region of the Carina Nebula, located some 8,000 light-years away
towards the constellation of Carina (the Keel). Trumpler 14 is not only the
youngest, but also one of the most populous clusters within the nebula.
Astronomers counted about 2000 stars in the very central parts of this cluster.
The MAD instrument allows astronomers to obtain very sharp images over a wide
area and this image is the adaptive optics image that so far covers the widest
area on the sky. The field of view is about 2 arcminutes across and the image is
based on data obtained through two different filters (K and H).

text> This image, the first to be released publicly from VISTA, the world’s
largest survey telescope, shows the spectacular star-forming region known as the
Flame Nebula, or NGC 2024, in the constellation of Orion (the Hunter) and its
surroundings. In views of this evocative object in visible light the core of the
nebula is completely hidden behind obscuring dust, but in this VISTA view, taken
in infrared light, the cluster of very young stars at the object’s heart is
revealed. The wide-field VISTA view also includes the glow of the reflection
nebula NGC 2023, just below centre, and the ghostly outline of the Horsehead
Nebula (Barnard 33) towards the lower right. The bright bluish star towards the
right is one of the three bright stars forming the Belt of Orion. The image was
created from VISTA images taken through J, H and Ks filters in the near-infrared
part of the spectrum. The image shows about half the area of the full VISTA
field and is about 40 x 50 arcminutes in extent. The total exposure time was 14
minutes. This image is available as a mounted image in the ESOshop. #L

text> GJ1214 is a star five times smaller than our Sun and three hundred times
less bright. Located only 40 light-years away from us, it is found to be
surrounded by a super-Earth planet whose interior is likely mostly made of water
ice. The planet appears to be rather hot and surrounded by a thick atmosphere,
which makes it inhospitable for life as we know it on Earth. This image is based
on data obtained through 2 different filters (blue and red), which were taken 7
years apart. Because the star is very close to the Earth, it has a large
apparent motion on the sky, and so has moved in between the 7 years. This is why
the star appears as a double coloured object in this image.

text> NGC 3603 is a starburst region : a cosmic factory where stars form
frantically from the nebula’s extended clouds of gas and dust. Located 22,000
light-years away from the Sun, it is the closest region of this kind known in
our galaxy, providing astronomers with a local test bed for studying the intense
star formation processes, very common in other galaxies, but hard to observe in
detail because of their large distance. The newly released image, obtained with
the FORS instrument attached to one of the four 8.2-metre VLT Unit Telescopes at
Cerro Paranal, Chile, is a three-colour combination of exposures acquired
through visible and near-infrared (V, R, I) filters. This image portrays a wider
field around the stellar cluster and reveals the rich texture of the surrounding
clouds of gas and dust. The field of view is 7 arcminutes wide. This image is

text> This very detailed enhanced-colour image from ESO’s Very Large Telescope
shows the dramatic effects of very young stars on the dust and gas from which
they were born in the star-forming region NGC 6729. The baby stars are invisible
in this picture, being hidden behind dust clouds at the upper left of the
picture, but material they are ejecting is crashing into the surroundings at
speeds of that can be as high as one million kilometres per hour. This picture
was taken by the FORS1 instrument and records the scene in the light of glowing
hydrogen and sulphur.

text> The first released VST image shows the spectacular star-forming region
Messier 17, also known as the Omega Nebula or the Swan Nebula, as it has never
been seen before. This vast region of gas, dust and hot young stars lies in the
heart of the Milky Way in the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer). The VST
field of view is so large that the entire nebula, including its fainter outer
parts, is captured — and retains its superb sharpness across the entire image.
The data were processed using the Astro-WISE software system developed by E.A.
Valentijn and collaborators at Groningen and elsewhere. #L

Centauri ever made. Omega Centauri, in the constellation of Centaurus (The
Centaur), is the largest globular cluster in the sky, but the very wide field of

text> The Antennae Galaxies (also known as NGC 4038 and 4039) are a pair of
distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light-years away, in the
constellation of Corvus (The Crow). This view combines ALMA observations, made
in two different wavelength ranges during the observatory’s early testing phase,
with visible-light observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. The
Hubble image is the sharpest view of this object ever taken and serves as the
ultimate benchmark in terms of resolution. ALMA observes at much longer
wavelengths which makes it much harder to obtain comparably sharp images.
However, when the full ALMA array is completed its vision will be up to ten
times sharper than Hubble. Most of the ALMA test observations used to create
this image were made using only twelve antennas working together — far fewer
than will be used for the first science observations — and much closer together
as well. Both of these factors make the new image just a taster of what is to
come. As the observatory grows, the sharpness, speed, and quality of its
observations will increase dramatically as more antennas become available and
the array grows in size. This is nevertheless the best submillimetre-wavelength
image ever taken of the Antennae Galaxies and opens a new window on the
submillimetre Universe. While visible light — shown here mainly in blue —
reveals the newborn stars in the galaxies, ALMA’s view shows us something that
cannot be seen at those wavelengths: the clouds of dense cold gas from which new
stars form. The ALMA observations — shown here in red, pink and yellow — were
made at specific wavelengths of millimetre and submillimetre light (ALMA bands 3
and 7), tuned to detect carbon monoxide molecules in the otherwise invisible
hydrogen clouds, where new stars are forming. Massive concentrations of gas are
found not only in the hearts of the two galaxies but also in the chaotic region
where they are colliding. Here, the total amount of gas is billions of times the
mass of the Sun — a rich reservoir of material for future generations of stars.
Observations like these will be vital in helping us understand how galaxy
collisions can trigger the birth of new stars. This is just one example of how
ALMA reveals parts of the Universe that cannot be seen with visible-light and
infrared telescopes. #L

ESO’s 50th Anniversary, 5 October 2012, with the help of Brigitte Bailleul —
winner of the Tweet Your Way to the VLT! competition. The observations were
broadcast live over the internet from the Paranal Observatory in Chile. This
object, also known as NGC 2359, lies in the constellation of Canis Major (The
Great Dog). The helmet-shaped nebula is around 15 000 light-years away from
Earth and is over 30 light-years across. The helmet is a cosmic bubble, blown as
the wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble’s centre sweeps through
the surrounding molecular cloud.

silhouetted against the pale pink glowing gas of the nebula. These globules are
under fierce bombardment from the ultraviolet radiation from nearby hot young
stars. They are both being eroded away and also fragmenting, rather like lumps
of butter dropped onto a hot frying pan. It is likely that Thackeray’s globules
will be destroyed before they can collapse and form new stars.

the star at the heart of this nebula made its final transition into retirement,
it shed its outer layers into space, forming this colourful cloud. The image
foreshadows the final fate of the Sun, which will eventually also become an
object of this kind.

text> This extraordinary bubble, glowing like the ghost of a star in the
haunting darkness of space, may appear supernatural and mysterious, but it is a
familiar astronomical object: a planetary nebula, the remnants of a dying star.
This is the best view of the little-known object ESO 378-1 yet obtained and was
captured by ESO’s Very Large Telescope in northern Chile.

text> In this huge image of part of the southern constellation of Norma (The
Carpenter’s Square) wisps of crimson gas are illuminated by rare, massive stars
that have only recently ignited and are still buried deep in thick dust clouds.
These scorching-hot, very young stars are only fleeting characters on the cosmic
stage and their origins remain mysterious. The vast nebula where these giants
were born, known as RCW 106, is captured here in fine detail by ESO’s VLT Survey
Telescope (VST), at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. The brightest part appears
just above the centre of the image. Many other interesting objects are also
captured in this wide-field image. For example the filaments to the right of the
image are the remnants of an ancient supernova (SNR G332.4-00.4, also known as
RCW 103), and the glowing red filaments at the lower left surround an unusual
and very hot star (RCW 104, surrounding the Wolf–Rayet star WR 75). Patches of
dark obscuring dust are also visible across the entire cosmic landscape.

These dramatic objects are regions of active star formation where the hot young
stars are causing the surrounding hydrogen gas to glow red. The very rich field
of view also includes dark clouds of dust. With around two billion pixels this
is one of the largest images ever released by ESO. A zoomable version of this
giant image is available here. Note that the circular features in the image
around bright stars are not real, they are due to reflections within the optics
of the telescope and camera.

text> The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy is a striking feature of the
southern sky even to the unaided eye. But visible-light telescopes cannot get a
really clear view of what is in the galaxy because of obscuring clouds of
interstellar dust. VISTA’s infrared capabilities have now allowed astronomers to
see the myriad of stars in this neighbouring galaxy much more clearly than ever
before. The result is this record-breaking image — the biggest infrared image
ever taken of the Small Magellanic Cloud — with the whole frame filled with
millions of stars. As well as the SMC itself this very wide-field image reveals
many background galaxies and several star clusters, including the very bright 47
Tucanae globular cluster at the right of the picture.

text> The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight
ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was
designed to capture images of a black hole. In coordinated press conferences
across the globe, EHT researchers revealed that they succeeded, unveiling the
first direct visual evidence of the supermassive black hole in the centre of
Messier 87 and its shadow. The shadow of a black hole seen here is the closest
we can come to an image of the black hole itself, a completely dark object from
which light cannot escape. The black hole’s boundary — the event horizon from
which the EHT takes its name — is around 2.5 times smaller than the shadow it
casts and measures just under 40 billion km across. While this may sound large,
this ring is only about 40 microarcseconds across — equivalent to measuring the
length of a credit card on the surface of the Moon. Although the telescopes
making up the EHT are not physically connected, they are able to synchronize
their recorded data with atomic clocks — hydrogen masers — which precisely time
their observations. These observations were collected at a wavelength of 1.3 mm
during a 2017 global campaign. Each telescope of the EHT produced enormous
amounts of data – roughly 350 terabytes per day – which was stored on
high-performance helium-filled hard drives. These data were flown to highly
specialised supercomputers — known as correlators — at the Max Planck Institute
for Radio Astronomy and MIT Haystack Observatory to be combined. They were then
painstakingly converted into an image using novel computational tools developed
by the collaboration.

text> Taken with the HAWK-I instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope in the
Chilean Atacama Desert, this stunning image shows the Milky Way’s central region
with an angular resolution of 0.2 arcseconds. This means the level of detail
picked up by HAWK-I is roughly equivalent to seeing a football (soccer ball) in
Zurich from Munich, where ESO’s headquarters are located. The image combines
observations in three different wavelength bands. The team used the broadband
filters J (centred at 1250 nanometres, in blue), H (centred at 1635 nanometres,
in green), and Ks (centred at 2150 nanometres, in red), to cover the near
infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. By observing in this range of
wavelengths, HAWK-I can peer through the dust, allowing it to see certain stars
in the central region of our galaxy that would otherwise be hidden.

text> This new ALMA image shows the outcome of a stellar fight: a complex and
stunning gas environment surrounding the binary HD101584. The colours represent
speed, going from blue — gas moving the fastest towards us — to red — gas moving
the fastest away from us. Jets, almost along the line of sight, propel the
material in blue and red. The stars in the binary are located at the single
bright dot at the centre of the ring-like structure shown in green, which is
moving with the same velocity as the system as a whole along the line of sight.
Astronomers believe this ring has its origin in the material ejected as the
lower mass star in the binary spiralled towards its red-giant partner.

text> The red supergiant star Betelgeuse, in the constellation of Orion, has
been undergoing unprecedented dimming. This stunning image of the star’s
surface, taken with the SPHERE instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope late
last year, is among the first observations to come out of an observing campaign
aimed at understanding why the star is becoming fainter. When compared with the
image taken in January 2019, it shows how much the star has faded and how its

Betelgeuse in December 2019. The clouds of dust, which resemble flames in this
dramatic image, are formed when the star sheds its material back into space. The
black disc obscures the star’s centre and much of its surroundings, which are
very bright and must be masked to allow the fainter dust plumes to be seen. The
orange dot in the middle is the SPHERE image of Betelgeuse’s surface, which has
a size close to that of Jupiter’s orbit.

This is the first time astronomers have directly observed more than one planet
orbiting a star similar to the Sun. The image was captured by blocking the light
from the young, Sun-like star (on the top left corner) using a coronagraph,
which allows for the fainter planets to be detected. The bright and dark rings
we see on the star’s image are optical artefacts. The two planets are visible as

text> ALMA, in which ESO is a partner, and the SPHERE instrument on ESO’s Very
Large Telescope have imaged GW Orionis, a triple star system with a peculiar
inner region. Unlike the flat planet-forming discs we see around many stars, GW
Orionis features a warped disc, deformed by the movements of the three stars at
its centre. This composite image shows both the ALMA and SPHERE observations of
the disc. The ALMA image shows the disc’s ringed structure, with the innermost
ring (part of which is visible as an oblong dot at the very centre of the image)
separated from the rest of the disc. The SPHERE observations allowed astronomers
to see for the first time the shadow of this innermost ring on the rest of the
disc, which made it possible for them to reconstruct its warped shape.

object at the centre of the Messier 87 (M87) galaxy: how it looks in polarised
light. This is the first time astronomers have been able to measure
polarisation, a signature of magnetic fields, this close to the edge of a black
hole. This image shows the polarised view of the black hole in M87. The lines
mark the orientation of polarisation, which is related to the magnetic field

individual light sources are stars, with the galaxy Centaurus A visible in the
centre of the image. While the telescope will be used to detect near-Earth
objects rather than observing galaxies, images like these are important to test
if the telescope is working as expected. Even during its commissioning phase,
the 56-centimetre telescope is already showing its promising capabilities, in
part thanks to the excellent sky quality at La Silla.

underwent an unprecedented dimming in late 2019 and early 2020. This stunning
image of the star’s surface was taken with the SPHERE instrument on ESO’s Very
Large Telescope in March 2020, and is one of the images taken during an
observing campaign aimed at understanding why the star became fainter.
Betelgeuse’s brightness returned to normal in April 2020. Astronomers now
understand that Betelgeuse’s dip in brightness was the result of a dusty veil
that emerged from the star, partially concealing its southern region.

text> When the red supergiant star Betelgeuse became visibly darker in late 2019
and early 2020, astronomers were puzzled. This image of the star was taken
before Betelgeuse started to fade, using the SPHERE instrument on ESO’s Very
Large Telescope. When compared with later images, taken in December 2019,
January 2020 and March 2020, it is clear that the southern region of the star
dimmed significantly, before beginning to its normal brightness. Astronomers now
know that this unprecedented dimming was the result of a cloud of dust that
emerged from the star. An earlier version of this image was released in early
2020.

light-years away and still in the process of being formed. The system features a
star at its centre and at least two planets orbiting it, PDS 70b (not visible in
the image) and PDS 70c, surrounded by a circumplanetary disc (the dot to the
right of the star). The planets have carved a cavity in the circumstellar disc
(the ring-like structure that dominates the image) as they gobbled up material
from the disc itself, growing in size. It was during this process that PDS 70c
acquired its own circumplanetary disc, which contributes to the growth of the
planet and where moons can form.

text> This image shows NGC1850, a cluster of thousands of stars roughly 160 000
light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a Milky Way neighbour. The
reddish filaments surrounding the cluster, made of vast clouds of hydrogen, are
believed to be the remnants of supernova explosions. The image is an overlay of
observations conducted in visible light with ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT)
and NASA/ESA’s Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The VLT captured the wide field of
the image and the filaments, while the central cluster was imaged by the HST.
Among many stars, this cluster is home to a black hole 11 times as massive as
the Sun and to a five-solar-mass star orbiting it. By looking at the star’s
orbit, a team of astronomers were able to infer the presence of the black hole,
making it the first small black hole outside of our galaxy to be found this way.
For this discovery, the team used the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
instrument at the VLT.

are on a collision course and form the closest pair of supermassive black holes
found to date. It is also the pair with the smallest separation between two
supermassive black holes — observed just 1600 light-years apart in the sky. The
image was taken with the MUSE instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at
the Paranal Observatory in Chile.

text> This image shows the most massive planet-hosting star pair to date, b
Centauri, and its giant planet b Centauri b. This is the first time astronomers
have directly observed a planet orbiting a star pair this massive and hot. The
star pair, which has a total mass of at least six times that of the Sun, is the
bright object in the top left corner of the image, the bright and dark rings
around it being optical artefacts. The planet, visible as a bright dot in the
lower right of the frame, is ten times as massive as Jupiter and orbits the pair
at 100 times the distance Jupiter orbits the Sun. The other bright dot in the
image (top right) is a background star. By taking different images at different
times, astronomers were able to distinguish the planet from the background
stars. The image was captured by the SPHERE instrument on ESO’s Very Large
Telescope and using a coronagraph, which blocked the light from the massive star
system and allowed astronomers to detect the faint planet.

text> This image shows a small area of the sky in the direction of the region
occupied by Upper Scorpius and Ophiucus. It zooms in on a recently discovered
rogue planet, meaning a planet that does not orbit a star but instead roams
freely on its own. The rogue planet is the tiny, bright red dot at the very
centre of the image. The image was created by combining data from the OmegaCam
instrument on VLT Survey Telescope (VST) and from the VIRCAM instrument on the
Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA), both located at
ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile. Observations with these and other
instruments helped the scientists tell the planets apart from stars, brown
dwarfs and other objects in this region of the sky. Lurking far away from any
star illuminating them, rogue planets would normally be impossible to image, but
shortly after formation they emit a faint glow that can be detected by sensitive
cameras on powerful telescopes.

text> This photo shows the newly discovered large jet in the HH-111 complex. The
straight jet emerges from the surrounding interstellar cloud in the lower part
of the picture. The outline of the cloud is vaguely visible by the brighter
background near the right edge of the picture. Also seen is a diffuse reflection
nebula around the lower part of the jet. This nebula is illuminated by the light
from the newborn star, hidden deep within the cloud. Because of the heavy
obscuration, the star itself is not visible on this photo. The jet produces a
“bow-shock” nebula; this is the bright, mushroom-shaped nebula in the upper part
of the picture. The round points are background stars in the Milky Way. Compare
this image with the graphic representation of the jet isophotes, also
accompanying this Press Release. The picture was produced as a composite of four
1 hour CCD exposures, obtained with the Danish 1.5 m telescope at La Silla
through a narrow optical filter. The light seen here from the jet is emitted by
singly ionised sulphur atoms. This photo is available in a B/W and a
false-colour version. (ESO Press Release eso8906; BW and Colour)

text> This is a direct image of HE 2347-4342 at the centre of a 7.5 x 7.5 arcmin
2 sky field. HE 2347-4342 was discovered in October 1995 by Lutz Wisotzki from
the University of Hamburg; the ‘HE’ stands for Hamburg-ESO . The visual
magnitude is 16.1, i.e. `only’ 10,000 times fainter than what can be seen with
the naked eye; this makes it one of the apparently brightest quasars in the sky
found so far. Still, it is quite distant - the measured redshift is z = 2.885.
This places it at a distance that implies a look-back time of more than 80% of
the age of the Universe. We thus observe it, as it was, just a few billion years
after the Big Bang. Being so bright in the sky and yet so distant means that HE
2347-4342 must be one of the intrinsically brightest objects in the Universe. In
fact, it is no less than 10 15 times more luminous than the Sun, or 10,000 times
brighter than the entire Milky Way galaxy in which we live.

text> This colour image shows objects as faint as 26th magnitude and it
illustrates well the performance in deep imaging at good angular resolution with
a relatively modest investment in exposure time at a 4m-class ground-based
telescope. Of the approximately 500 galaxies detected in this field, the largest
fraction are expected to be at redshifts smaller than z = 1 and about 20 percent
to have higher redshifts, up to z = 4 and possibly beyond. During this project,
a total of 122 CCD frames were obtained in four colours [blue (B), green-yellow
(V), red (r) and near-infrared (i-band)] with a total exposure time of no less
than 31.5 hours. Total exposure times of 50400, 23400, 23400, 16200 seconds were
obtained in the four bands, respectively. The frames cover a 2.3 x 2.3 arcmin
‘empty sky’ field centered south of the high-redshift quasar QSO BR 1202-0725 (z
= 4.7), located just south of the celestial equator. These frames have been
combined to produce a ‘true’ colour image in the sense that ‘blue’, ‘green’ and
‘red’ represent the B-, V- and (r+i)-frames, respectively. This version of the
combined image has a high contrast that shows the faintest objects recorded.

than 31.5 hours. Total exposure times of 50400, 23400, 23400, 16200 seconds were
obtained in the four bands, respectively. The frames cover a 2.3 x 2.3 arcmin
‘empty sky’ field centered south of the high-redshift quasar QSO BR 1202-0725 (z
= 4.7), located just south of the celestial equator. These frames have been
combined to produce a ‘true’ colour image in the sense that ‘blue’, ‘green’ and
‘red’ represent the B-, V- and (r+i)-frames, respectively. This version of the
combined image has a lower contrast and brings forward structural details in the
brighter objects in the field.

text> This is a composite of three 1-min exposures of the Orion Nebula through
narrow band filters centred on the 2.166 micron Br-gamma atomic hydrogen line
(here reproduced in blue colour), the 1.257 micron [FeII] line (green) and the
2.12 micron 1-0 S(1) molecular hydrogen line (red). The colour coding reflects
the ionisation state of the gas. Br-gamma traces hydrogen gas that is ionised by
the well known Trapezium and other hot, young, stars in the region ; the [FeII]
emission is emitted by high velocity fragments ejected during the birth of new
stars in the OMC1 molecular cloud. The hollow filaments seen in molecular
hydrogen result from shock heating of the molecular gas in the wake of the
outflowing matter. In this image, the scale is 0.29 arcsec/pixel ; the field is
5x5 arcmin with North at the top and East to the left ; the seeing was around
0.5 arcsec.

text> This is a J band image (1.25 micron) of the galaxy cluster Abell 370
(A370; redshift z = 0.375), obtained in ‘jitter’ mode, showing the famous
gravitational arc just below the centre. The observations consisted of 24
exposures of 2 min each, made on randomly generated telescope positions within a
sky region of 30 x 30 arcsec. The individual exposures have been sky subtracted
using a running average determined from the same data and then re-centred and
combined. The scale is 0.29 arcsec/pixel; the field is about 5 x 5 arcmin with
North at the top and East to the left. The seeing was less optimal, about 1.2
arcsec. A J = 22 mag point source yields a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 within a 3

text> The globular cluster Messier 4 (M4 for short) is located about 6,000
light-years away. On the sky, it is seen in the southern constellation Scorpius,
It is an ensemble of about 500,000 stars, held together by their mutual
gravitational pull. There are about 150 such clusters in our Galaxy, and M4 is
the one closest to us. This colour picture has been obtained by combining three
images taken through three different filters at the wavelengths of blue, green,
and red light. They were obtained during the night of May 22, 1998. In this way,
the stars are seen in their true colours, ranging from blue for very hot stars
(about 10,000 degrees) to red for the cooler ones (about 4,000 degrees). With an
exposure time of only 2 minutes, the VLT has been able to detect in the blue
light stars as faint as magnitude 24. This corresponds to 15 million times
dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye. This was achieved even
though the image has a fairly high background, being taken with the Moon above
the horizon (3 days before New Moon, with 18% illumination). The large mirror
surface of the VLT UT1 (53 m 2 ) and its ability to produce very sharp images
(measured as 0.53 arcsec on these images), unequalled by any ground-based
telescope, ensures that faint objects may be observed extremely efficiently,
especially under the good conditions that prevailed during this observation.
Note that, because of the limitations in the printing process, these faint stars
cannot easily be seen in this glossy reproduction.

text> This splendid colour image of a famous southern Planetary Nebula, NGC 6302
or the Bug Nebula (sometimes nicknames the Butterfly Nebula), was obtained by
combining blue, yellow and red images obtained on May 22, 1998, with 10 minute
exposures and an image quality better than 0.6 arcseconds. Towards the end of
their life, some massive stars expand to giant dimensions. They shed most of the
hydrogen in their outer layers as a strong “stellar wind”, before they contract
towards a final compact stage as “white dwarfs”. After this ejection process,
the star remains thousands of times brighter and also much hotter than the Sun
during a few thousand years. Its strong ultraviolet radiation has the effect of
ionizing the previously ejected gas, which then shines before it disperses into
interstellar space. The resulting nebulae (traditionally referred to as
Planetary Nebulae , because of their resemblance to a planet in a small
telescope) often exhibit very complex morphologies. The Butterfly Nebula belongs
to the class of bipolar nebulae, as this picture clearly illustrates. A dark,
dusty and disc-like structure - seen edge-on in this image - obscures the
central star from our view. However, its strong radiation escapes perpendicular
to the disk and heats and illuminates the material deposited there by the
stellar wind. The origin of the dark disk may be due to the central star being a
member of a double star system. This has been shown to be the case in some other
bipolar nebulae in which, contrary to the Butterfly Nebula, there is a direct
view towards the star.

text> This is a colour photo from the VLT that shows NGC 4650A, a member of the
so-called Centaurus chain of galaxies in the southern constellation of that
name. NGC 4650A is a complex system that is located at a distance of about 50
Megaparsec (165 million light-years). As it is clear from this high-resolution
picture, there are two main components, a lenticular-shaped galaxy (of type S0),
surrounded by a knotty extended ring-like distribution of stars, dust and gas,
nearly perpendicular to each other. This is a combination of three 10-min B
(blue) exposures (seeing 0.68 - 0.82 arcsec), two 10-min V (green-yellow)
exposures (0.55 and 0.77 arcsec), and one 4-min and one 10-min R (red) exposures
(0.55 and 0.52 arcsec) with the VLT Test Camera. Individual frames were
flat-fielded and cleaned for cosmics, combined and deconvolved with the
Richardson-Lucy algorithm to produce a final FWHM = 0.53 arcsec before colour
combination. The field measures 1.5 x 1.5 arcmin. North is to the upper left;
East is to the lower left.

text> IC 4406 is a planetary nebula with an unusual, almost “rectangular” shape.
It is located in the southern constellation Lupus (the Wolf). The distance is
somewhat uncertain, possibly around 5,000 light-years. Like the Butterfly Nebula
(cf. VLT UT1 First Light Photo No. 4), IC 4406 belongs to the class of bipolar
nebulae. However, the dark and dusty central band (the “disc-like structure”) is
less pronounced in this object and the internal structure is more uniform. The
different colours correspond to regions of different composition and physical
properties. This is a combination of two 5-min B (blue) exposures (seeing 0.95
arcsec), two 5-min V (green-yellow) exposures (0.90 arcsec), and one 5-min and
two 2-min R (red) exposures (0.70 to 0.90 arcsec) with the VLT Test Camera.
Individual frames were flat-fielded and cleaned for cosmics before colour
combination; there was no further image processing. The field measures 1.5 x 1.5
arcmin. North is to the upper right; East is to the upper left.

text> The galaxy ESO 342-G017 was observed on August 19, 1998 during a spell of
excellent observing conditions. Two exposures, each lasting 120 seconds, were
taken through a red filtre to produce this photo. The quality of the original
images is excellent, with seeing (FWHM) of only 0.26 arcsec measured on the
stars in the frame. ESO 342-G017 is an Sc-type spiral galaxy seen edge-on, and
the Test Camera was rotated so that the disc of the galaxy appears horizontal in
the figure. Thanks to the image quality, the photo shows much detail in the
rather flat disc, including a very thin, obscuring dust band and some brighter
knots, most probably star-forming regions.This image is reproduced from a
composite of two 120-second exposures in the red R-band (~600 nm) of the edge-on
galaxy ESO342-G017, both with 0.26 arcsec image quality. The frames were
flat-fielded and cleaned for cosmics before combination. The field shown
measures 1.5 x 1.5 arcmin. North is inclined 38 o clockwise from the top, East
is to the left.

text> This spectacular image of the large spiral galaxy NGC 1232 was obtained on
September 21, 1998, during a period of good observing conditions. It is based on
three exposures in ultra-violet, blue and red light, respectively. The colours
of the different regions are well visible : the central areas contain older
stars of reddish colour, while the spiral arms are populated by young, blue
stars and many star-forming regions. Note the distorted companion galaxy on the
left side, shaped like the greek letter “theta”. NGC 1232 is located 20º south
of the celestial equator, in the constellation Eridanus (The River). The
distance is about 60 million light-years, but the excellent optical quality of
the VLT and FORS allows us to see an incredible wealth of details. At the
indicated distance, the edge of the field shown corresponds to about 200,000
light-years, or about twice the size of the Milky Way galaxy. The image is a
composite of three images taken behind three different filters: U (360 nm; 10
min), B (420 nm; 6 min) and R (600 nm; 2:30 min) during a period of 0.7 arcsec
seeing. The field shown measures 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin. North is up; East is to the

text> This image is of the central region of the large spiral galaxy NGC 1232
and was obtained on September 21, 1998, during a period of good observing
conditions. It is based on three exposures in ultra-violet, blue and red light,
respectively. This central area contains older stars of reddish colour. Images
eso9845d and eso9845e are based on a composite of three images taken behind
three different filters: U (360 nm; 10 min), B (420 nm; 6 min) and R (600 nm;
2:30 min) during a period of 0.7 arcsec seeing. The fields shown measure 6.8 x
6.8 arcmin and 1.6 x 1.8 arcmin, respectively. North is up; East is to the left.

text> The Dumbbell Nebula ­— also known as Messier 27 or NGC 6853 — is a typical
planetary nebula and is located in the constellation Vulpecula (The Fox). The
distance is rather uncertain, but is believed to be around 1,200 light-years. It
was first described by the French astronomer and comet hunter Charles Messier
who found it in 1764 and included it as no. 27 in his famous list of extended
sky objects [2] .Despite its class, the Dumbbell Nebula has nothing to do with
planets. It consists of very rarified gas that has been ejected from the hot
central star (well visible on this photo), now in one of the last evolutionary
stages. The gas atoms in the nebula are excited (heated) by the intense
ultraviolet radiation from this star and emit strongly at specific
wavelengths.This image is the beautiful by-product of a technical test of some
FORS1 narrow-band optical interference filtres. They only allow light in a small
wavelength range to pass and are used to isolate emissions from particular atoms
and ions. In this three-colour composite, a short exposure was first made
through a wide-band filtre registering blue light from the nebula. It was then
combined with exposures through two interference filtres in the light of
double-ionized oxygen atoms and atomic hydrogen. They were colour-coded as
“blue”, “green” and “red”, respectively, and then combined to produce this
picture that shows the structure of the nebula in “approximately true”
colours.They are three-colour composite based on two interference ([OIII] at 501
nm and 6 nm FWHM — 5 min exposure time; H-alpha at 656 nm and 6 nm FWHM — 5 min)
and one broadband (Bessell B at 429 nm and 88 nm FWHM; 30 sec) filtre images,
obtained on September 28, 1998, during mediocre seeing conditions (0.8 arcsec).
The CCD camera has 2048 x 2048 pixels, each covering 24 x 24 µm and the sky
fields shown measure 6.8 x 6.8 arcminutes and 3.5 x 3.9 arcminutes,
respectively. North is up; East is left.

(redshift z = 0.3), combining a 20 min jittered ISAAC Ks (2.16µm) exposure with
15 min V (green-yellow) and R (red) exposures, obtained with the VLT Test Camera
at the UT1 Nasmyth focus. In addition to the prominent blue arc, produced by
gravitational lensing of a galaxy at redshift z = 2.24, there are also notable,
very red arcs, both closer to the centre and further out. They were only
detected in the infrared image and are probably due to lensing of a much more
distant galaxy.

light of a very distant object is deformed by the foreground cluster. Abell 370,
at the center of the photo, contains a large number of galaxies — most of them
are ellipticals. The two brightest red galaxies slightly above the gravitational

which do not contain bright stars that might reduce the image quality due to
scattered light. This FORS “deep field” hosts the quasar Q0103-260, which is
visible as a bright white source near the bottom, to the lower left (south-east)

respect to each other so that the small gaps between the eight CCD’s of the
mosaic are no longer visible. This image also shows the faint trails of 2
artificial satellites. Many of the quite numerous and small, slightly fuzzy
objects are undoubtedly globular clusters of NGC 253. The image processing
consisted of de-biassing, flat-fielding, and removal (by interpolation) of some
bad columns. The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of stellar images is about 1.0
arcsec. It was rebinned (2x2) to 4kx4k size and sampling 0.48 arcsec/pixel.North

R (red) optical bands. Many background galaxies are seen in the field. The total
exposure times were 2400 sec, 2400 sec and 5400 sec, respectively. The seeing
varied between 0.5 and 0.7 arcsec. The field measures about 7 x 7 arcmin 2.
North is up and East is left. Very high quality images of Antlia were obtained
in different colours by FORS1 on VLT UT1 in the period 27 - 31 January 1999.
These data were taken around full moon, so they do not show as faint stars as
they would under normal FORS operating conditions, but the image quality is
exceptional. They represent by far the best images ever obtained of this galaxy,
and they include the first deep B-band images.

text> Colour a composite of three individual exposures, taken with FORS1 at the
VLT UT1 on 3 February 1999. They were obtained through B (blue), V (green), and
H-alpha (red) filters, and each of them was bias-subtracted and flat-fielded
before combination. The field-of-view is 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin 2, corresponding to an
area of just over 300 x 300 light-years 2 at the distance of the Large
Magellanic Cloud. The exposure times were 60, 60 and 450 seconds and the image
quality was 1.0, 0.7 and 0.8 arcsec (FWHM) for the B, V, and H-alpha frames,
respectively. The intensity scale is linear for the B and V images and
logarithmic for H-alpha, in order to enhance the fine structure of the faintest
parts of the nebulosity. North is 33° to the right of the vertical. It is a
composite of blue and green images plus an image in the light of Hydrogen. It
shows that there is indeed still much gas around NGC 1850. While part of this
may well be the remnant of the “parent” gas cloud (i.e. the one from which both
clusters were born), the presence of filaments and of various sharp “shocks”,
e.g. to the left and below NGC 1850, offers support to the theory of
supernova-induced star birth in the younger of the two clusters. Some
“protostars” are located near or in some of the filaments — this is interpreted
as additional evidence for that theory. The nebulosity directly above the main
cluster, that is shaped like a “3”, is the well-known supernova remnant N103B
which itself may also be associated with NGC 1850.

text> This is a computer processed “(U-B) colour-index image” of NGC 1232. This
technique allows to show the “difference” between images of the galaxy, as seen
in different wavebands. Since different types of objects have different
brightness in different colours, this method is very useful to locate objects of
a particular type and to obtain an overview of their distribution in the galaxy.
The photo is based on two individual images of NGC 1232 obtained by the FORS1
Commissioning Team at the ESO VLT UT1 on 20 September 1998. They were taken in
ultraviolet (“U-band”) and blue (“B-band”) light. The exposure times were 10 min
and 6 min, respectively. To obtain this colour-index image, the two images were
carefully recentered and then divided numerically. Star formation regions that
emit strong ultraviolet light therefore appear as particularly bright areas in
this colour-index image. They trace the shock fronts of the gas in the spiral
arms. The field measures about 5.5 x 5.5 arcmin 2. North is up and East is left.

is assembled from five 15-minute R(ed)-narrowband (shown in red), four 5-minute
B(lue)-band (shown in green), and five 1000-second U(ltraviolet)-band (shown in
blue) exposures, obtained in January 1999 during the Science Verification phase
with the Wide-Field-Imager (WFI) at the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope at La Silla. At
the recession velocity of NGC 4945, the red filter, centred at 665 nm with an
FWHM (full width at half maximum) of only 1.2 nm, does not include the H-alpha
emission line of interstellar hydrogen in this galaxy. The original resolution
of about 1 arcsec corresponds to roughly 62 light-years at the distance of NGC
4945 (13 million light-years). In addition to NGC 4945 itself, some much more
distant galaxies can be recognized as faint, slightly red light patches in the
field. The vast majority of the point-like sources are stars in the Milky Way.
However, a fair number of those near NGC 4945 are globular clusters belonging to
this galaxy. Each frame records 8184 x 8196 = 67,076,064 pixels, and thus the
total number of data points (pixels) of the 14 CCD frames used to make this
photo is almost 10 9. Their collective information content corresponds to more
than 70 x 10 9 photons (not counting those from the Earth’s upper atmosphere
that were recorded simultaneously). The field covers 32 x 32 arcmin 2. East is

(The Water-Snake). The distance to this 8-mag cluster is about 35,000 light
years, and the diameter is about 140 light-years. The excellent image quality is
0.38 arcsec, demonstrating a good optical and mechanical state of the telescope,
already at this early stage of the commissioning phase. The field measures about

in the southern constellation Centaurus at a distance of about 150 million
light-years. Many galaxies are seen in this direction at about the same
distance, forming a loose cluster; there are also some fainter, more distant
ones in the background. The designation refers to the ESO/Uppsala Survey of the
Southern Sky in the 1970’s during which over 15,000 southern galaxies were
catalogued. ESO 269-57 is a tightly bound object of type Sar, the “r” referring
to the “ring” that surrounds the bright centre, that is overexposed here. The
photo is a composite, based on three exposures (Blue - 600 sec; Yellow-Green -
300 sec; Red - 300 sec) obtained with KUEYEN on March 28, 1999. The image

(left), in the southern constellation Centaurus. The first is a typical S0
galaxy with a bright diffuse centre, surrounded by a fainter envelope of stars
(not resolved in this picture). However, some of the starlike objects seen in
this region may be globular clusters (or dwarf galaxies) in orbit around NGC
5090. The other galaxy is of type Sa (the spiral structure is more developed)
and is seen at a steep angle. The three-colour composite is based on frames
obtained with KUEYEN on March 29, 1999, with the same filters and exposure times

text> This photograph shows an unusual sky field in the Milky Way band. It is
centred on one of the classical, dark globules, known as Barnard 68 (B68) after
the American astronomer, Edward E. Barnard (1857 - 1923), who included it in a
list of such objects, published in 1919. It appears as a compact, opaque and
rather sharply defined object against a rich, background star field. Even on
this image that registers many faint stars in the area, not a single foreground
star is observed. This is a clear sign that this globule must be relatively
nearby. Interstellar clouds consist of gas and dust, including many molecules,
some of which contain carbon atoms (i.e. organic). For a long time considered to
be “holes in the sky”, molecular clouds are now known to be among the coolest
objects in the Universe (the temperature is approx. 10 K, or -263 °C). Moreover,
and most importantly, they are nurseries of stars and planets. It still remains
a mystery how a dark cloud like Barnard 68 at some moment begins to contract and
subsequently transforms itself into hydrogen-burning stars. However, deep images
of these clouds, such as this one obtained by FORS1 on VLT ANTU, may provide
important clues. This small cloud seems to be in its very earliest phase of
collapse. It has a diameter of only 7 light-months (approx. 0.2 pc) and it is
located at a distance of about 500 light-years (160 pc) towards the southern
constellation Ophiuchus (The Serpent-holder). This three-colour composite was
reproduced from one blue (B), one green-yellow (V) and one near-infrared (I)
exposure that were obtained with VLT ANTU and FORS1 in the early morning of
March 27, 1999. The field measures 6.8x6.8 arcmin 2. The image consists of
2048x2048 pixels, each measuring 0.20 arcsec; the “Full Resolution” version of
the photo shows all of these. North is up and East is to the left. (See also ESO
Press Release eso0102.)

text> Three-colour composite reproduced from one blue (B), one green-yellow (V)
and one red (R) exposure, obtained with FORS1 at ANTU in the morning of March
29, 1999. The field size is again 6.8x6.8 arcmin 2 . It shows the spectacular
barred spiral galaxy NGC 6872 that is shaped like an “integral sign”. It is of
type SBb and is accompanied by a smaller, interacting galaxy, IC 4970 of type S0
(just above the centre). The bright object to the lower right of the galaxies is
a star in the Milky Way whose image has been strongly overexposed and exhibits
multiple optical reflections in the telescope and instrument. There are also
many other, fainter and more distant galaxies of many different forms in the
field. They are particularly well visible on the “Normal” and “Full Resolution”
versions of the photo. The upper left spiral arm of NGC 6872 is significantly
disturbed and is populated by a plethora of blueish objects, many of which are
star-forming regions. This may have been be caused by a recent passage of IC
4970 through it. This interesting system is located in the southern
constellation Pavo (The Peacock). It is comparatively distant, almost 300
million light-years away. It extends over more than 7 arcmin in the sky and its
real size from tip to tip is thus nearly 750,000 light-years. It is in fact one
of the largest known, barred spiral galaxies. In order to image all of this
extraordinary object within the available field of the FORS1 camera, the
instrument was rotated so that the galaxy extends along the diagonal. For this
reason, the orientation is such that North is to the upper right and East is to
the upper left.

text> ESO 269-57 is a spectacular spiral galaxy of symmetrical shape in the
southern constellation Centaurus and belongs to a well-known cluster of galaxies
seen in this direction. The galaxy received this designation when it was
catalogued during the first ESO Survey of the Southern Sky in the 1970’s. This
photograph shows the complex structure of ESO 269-57, with an inner “ring”, of
several tightly wound spiral arms, surrounded by two outer ones that appear to
split into several branches. Many blue and diffuse objects are visible — most
are star-forming regions. The galaxy type is Sa(r). The velocity is just over
3,100 km/sec, indicating a distance of about 155 million light-years. It extends
over about 4 arcmin in the sky, corresponding to nearly 200,000 light-years
across. Many other galaxies are visible in the background. In this and the other
photos, the vertical lines extending from the images of some bright stars result
from a “bleeding” effect in the CCD detector where the pixels are completely
saturated. This three-colour composite (BVR) was obtained with VLT ANTU and
FORS1 in the morning of March 27, 1999. The full field measures 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin
2. North is up and East is to the left.

text> A pair of galaxies NGC 5090 - 5091 in Centaurus is shown in this image.
They are located at about the same distance as ESO 269-57 and may belong to the
same cluster of galaxies. This is an interacting elliptical-spiral system with
some evidence of tidal disruption of NGC 5091 (to the left; seen under a steep
angle) by NGC 5090 (to the right). The velocity of the nucleus of NGC 5091 has
been measured as 3429 km/sec, while NGC 5090 has a velocity of 3185 km/sec. NGC
5090 is associated with a strong, double radio source (PKS 1318-43). This
three-colour composite (BVR) was obtained with VLT ANTU and FORS1 in the morning
of March 29, 1999. A bright star in the Milky Way, just outside the field at the
upper left, has produced a pattern of blue straylight. The field size is 6.8x6.8
arcmin 2. North is up and East is to the left.

text> Image showing a sky field in the southern constellation Hydra (The
Water-snake) that includes the peculiar spiral galaxy ESO 510-13 . It resembles
the famous “Sombrero” galaxy, but its equatorial dust plane is pronouncedly
warped. The velocity is 3300 km/sec, the distance is about 170 million
light-years and the size is 100,000 light-years. The fact that the dust band and
the rest of this galaxy are not well aligned is a clear sign that the former was
acquired recently (in astronomical terms). The dust band is still in the process
of achieving a more stable state by becoming flat. It is not obvious how it was
formed; it may for instance be the result of a merger with a gas-rich dwarf
galaxy and the elliptical galaxy. In any case, this is a most interesting object
that will undoubtedly soon be studied in more detail, with the VLT and other
large telescopes. The photo displays a very large number of fainter objects near
this galaxy. Many of these are likely to be globular clusters of stars
associated with the galaxy; others are background galaxies. It would indeed
appear that ESO 510-13 is located right in front of one or more, distant
clusters of galaxies. This three-colour composite (BVI) was obtained with VLT
ANTU and FORS in the morning of March 15, 1999. Field size: 6.8x6.8 arcmin 2 ;

the southern constellations Carina (The Ship’s Keel) and Volans (The Flying
Fish). It contains a spiral galaxy, ESO 60-24 that is seen nearly edge-on. This
galaxy has a strong equatorial dust band that hides the light from the stars
behind it. A bright centre is located just below the dust band and the spiral
structure may be perceived in the outer regions. The velocity is 4,000 km/sec,
corresponding to a distance of about 200 million light-years. These observations

text> RCW 108 is a molecular cloud that is in the process of being destroyed by
intense ultraviolet radiation from heavy and hot stars in the nearby stellar
cluster NGC 6193, seen to the left in the photo. A series of images were
obtained with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) of areas in the Milky Way band,
including some in which interstellar nebulae of gas and dust are seen. Each
frame records 8184 x 8196, or over 67 million, pixels in a sky field of 32 x 32
arcmin 2. The photo shows the RCW 108 complex of bright and dark nebulae in the
southern association Ara OB1, a star-forming region in the constellation Ara
(the Altar), deep in the southern sky. The resolution in this image has been
degraded by reducing the number of pixels in one direction from about 8000 to
3000 in the “High-Resolution version”, in order to make the image transportable
over the web without incurring completely unacceptable transfer times. Still, it
is very large, even in the highly compressed jpeg format, reflecting the great
amount of details visible. This colour picture is a composite made from 12
separate images, obtained with the WFI on 27 March 1999. The blue component
corresponds to the B filter, the green to the V filter, and the red to the
H-alpha filter. The images in each filter are the composite of 4 individual
frames obtained with the telescope pointing at slightly different positions on
the sky, so that the parts of the sky falling in the gaps between the 8
individual 2k x 4k CCDs in any given frame are recorded on the others. The
monochromatic images are then produced by superimposing the individual frames,
correcting for the telescope offsets ; this ensures that the complete field is
well covered. This procedure is not simple, as the observing conditions may
change slightly from exposure to exposure, resulting in small differences.
Finally, the combined images in each filter are aligned and colour-coded to
produce the colour picture. For the processing of this large photo (8k x 8k; 256
Mbytes), a minimum of contrast correction was made and very faint lines may
still be perceived in some places where the individual frames were joined. It
may also be noted that there is a slight misalignment of the individual colours
in stellar images at the extreme corners of the large field. This is due to the
effect of differential atmospheric refraction, i.e. light rays of different
colours are bent differently in air. The exposure time was 300 sec for each
frame in H-alpha, and 60 sec in B and V. East is to the left and North to the
top.

well-studied complex in the LMC, somewhat apart from the other nebulae in this

text> B68 is a dark cloud situated at a distance of about 500 light-years (160
pc) towards the southern constellation Ophiuchus (The Serpent-holder). This is a
false-colour, infrared composite photo of the dark cloud Barnard 68, obtained on
March 8-9, 1999, with the SOFI instrument at the ESO 3.5-m New Technology
Telescope (NTT) at La Silla. Three exposures were made through J- (wavelength
1.25 µm - 3 min; here colour-coded as “blue”), H- (1.65 µm - 30 min; “green”)
and Ks-filters (2.16 µm - 30 min; “red”), respectively. The “reddening” of the
background stars that are seen through the cloud is very obvious. It is due to
the larger obscuration in shorter wavebands. The sky field measures about 4.9 x
4.9 arcmin 2 (1024x1024 pixels). A slight mismatch between the individual frames
is present in the upper corners; this is caused by atmospheric effects. The
pixel size is 0.29/arcsec. North is up and East is left.

text> These images of the NGC 3603 region were obtained in three near-IR filter
bands (Js, H and Ks) with the ISAAC instrument at the ANTU telescope at the VLT
at Paranal. NGC 3603 is located in the Carina spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy
at a distance of about 20,000 light-years (6-7 kpc). It is the only massive,
galactic “HII-region” (so denoted by astronomers because part of its hydrogen is
ionized) in which a central cluster of strongly UV-radiating stars of types O
and B that ionize the nebula can be studied at visual and near-infrared
wavelengths. This is because the line-of-sight is reasonably free of dust in
this direction; the dimming in near-infrared radiation due to intervening matter
between the nebula and us is only about a factor of 2 (compared to 80 in visible
light). The total mass of the hot O and B stars in NGC 3603 is over 2,000 solar
masses. Together, the more than fifty heavy and bright O stars in NGC 3603 have
about 100 times the ionizing power of the well-known Trapezium cluster in the
Orion Nebula. In fact, the star cluster in NGC 3603 is in many respects very
similar to the core of the large, ionizing cluster in the approximately eight
times more distant Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An important
conclusion of studying this region is that there are lots of sub-solar mass
stars in NGC 3603. Contrary to several theoretical predictions, these low-mass
stars do form in violent starbursts. The overall age of stars in the contraction
phase that are located in the innermost region of NGC 3603 was found to be 300
000 to 1 000 000 years. The counts clearly show that this cluster is well
populated in sub-solar mass stars. This image is available as a mounted image in
the ESOshop.

the Milky Way. The field shown is about 2.5 x 2.5 light-years 2. It hosts more
than 50 hot O-type stars. The brightest star in the field is the red supergiant
IRS4 ; it is located about 80 arcsec NE of the center. About 18 arcsec N of the
center are the ring nebula and the bipolar outflows around the blue supergiant
Sher25. The photo also shows three proplyd-like objects ; they are similar to
those seen in Orion Nebula, but 20-30 times more extended. About 1 arcmin SSE of
the central cluster are seen the brightest members of the deeply embedded proto
cluster IRS9 .

text> Three-colour composite of the young object Herbig-Haro 34 (HH-34), now in
the protostar stage of evolution. It is based on CCD frames obtained with the
FORS2 instrument in imaging mode, on November 2 and 6, 1999. This object has a
remarkable, very complicated appearance that includes two opposite jets that ram
into the surrounding interstellar matter. This structure is produced by a
machine-gun-like blast of “bullets” of dense gas ejected from the star at high
velocities (approaching 250 km/sec). This seems to indicate that the star
experiences episodic “outbursts” when large chunks of material fall onto it from
a surrounding disc. HH-34 is located at a distance of approx. 1,500 light-years,
near the famous Orion Nebula, one of the most productive star birth regions.
Note also the enigmatic “waterfall” to the upper left, a feature that is still
unexplained. The composite of three images was taken through three different
filters : B (wavelength 429 nm; Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) 88 nm; exposure
time 10 min; here rendered as blue), H-alpha (centered on the hydrogen emission
line at wavelength 656 nm; FWHM 6 nm; 30 min; green) and S II (centrered at the
emission lines of inonized sulphur at wavelength 673 nm; FWHM 6 nm; 30 min; red)
during a period of 0.8 arcsec seeing. The field shown measures 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin
and the images were recorded in frames of 2048 x 2048 pixels, each measuring 0.2
arcsec. North is up; East is left.

“Super Bubble” in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy to the
Milky Way system, located in the southern sky at a distance of about 160,000

luminous bubble of interstellar gas, measuring about 300 light-years in
diameter. It was created by winds from hot, massive stars and supernova
explosions and the interior is filled with tenuous, hot expanding gas. An object
like N70 provides astronomers with an excellent opportunity to explore the
connection between the life-cycles of stars and the evolution of galaxies. Very
massive stars profoundly affect their environment. They stir and mix the
interstellar clouds of gas and dust, and they leave their mark in the
compositions and locations of future generations of stars and star systems.

text> This photo shows a three colour composite of the well-known Crab Nebula
(also known as Messier 1), as observed with the FORS2 instrument in imaging mode
in the morning of November 10, 1999. It is the remnant of a supernova explosion
at a distance of about 6,000 light-years, observed almost 1,000 years ago, in
the year 1054. It contains a neutron star near its centre that spins 30 times
per second around its axis (see below). In this picture, the green light is
predominantly produced by hydrogen emission from material ejected by the star
that exploded. The blue light is predominantly emitted by very high-energy
(“relativistic”) electrons that spiral in a large-scale magnetic field
(so-called synchrotron emission). It is believed that these electrons are
continuously accelerated and ejected by the rapidly spinning neutron star at the
centre of the nebula and which is the remnant core of the exploded star. This
pulsar has been identified with the lower/right of the two close stars near the
geometric centre of the nebula, immediately left of the small arc-like feature,
best seen in ESO Press Photo eso9948. Technical information: ESO Press Photo
eso9948 is based on a composite of three images taken through three different
optical filters: B (429 nm; FWHM 88 nm; 5 min; here rendered as blue), R (657

text> This image of a well-known spiral galaxy, Messier 83, was prepared by
superposing three CCD frames from this data release that are now available in
the archive. This galaxy is located in the southern constellation Hydra (The
Water-Snake) and is also known as NGC 5236; the distance is about 15 million
light-years. The spiral structure resembles that of the Milky Way Galaxy in
which we live, but Messier 83 also possesses a bar-like structure at the centre.
This photo shows the central region of a beautiful spiral galaxy, Messier 83, as
observed with the FORS1 instrument at VLT ANTU . It is based on a composite of
three images, all of which are now available from the ESO Science Data Archive,
as described in this Press Release. The three frames were taken in March 1999
through three different filters: B (wavelength 429 nm; Full-Width-Half-Maximum
(FWHM) 88 nm; exposure time 10 min; here rendered as blue), R (657 nm; 150 nm; 3
min; green) and I (768 nm; 138 nm; 3 min; red) during a period of 0.8 arcsec
average seeing. The field shown measures about 6.8 x 6.8 arcmin and the images
were recorded in frames of 2048 x 2048 pixels, each measuring 0.2 arcsec. North
is up; East is left. Compare also with ESO Press Photo eso9826 (in B/W) of a
small area in this galaxy that was obtained with the VLT Test Camera in June
1998.

text> This image displays a 0.5° x 0.5° sky area in the direction of the
so-called AXAF Deep Field in which few bright objects are seen. This photo
results from the combination of 28 individual WFI exposures behind a B(lue)
optical filter with a total exposure time of 7 hours. About 100,000 galaxies are
visible in the original image that encompasses approx. 8000 x 8000 pixels (1
pixel = 0.24 arcsec). The light trail of an artificial satellite crosses the
field. The High-Res version included here has been compressed by a factor of
four in order to facilitate transport over the Web. North is up and East is
left. Twenty-eight exposures with a total integration time of 7 hours have been
co-added. After each single exposure, the telescope was offset by a small angle
in order to cover also the gaps between the eight CCD’s in the mosaic and to
enable removal of minor cosmetical blemishes of the detectors. Since the CCD
mosaic of the WFI comprises 67 million pixels, a total of 1,900 million data
points was thus used to construct this image. The related image processing,
using the EIS WFI data reduction pipeline, recently developed at ESO, kept a
powerful workstation fully busy for about 8 hours.

Norma (The Level) and in the direction of the “Great Attractor”. This region is
at an angular distance of about 7° from the main plane of the Milky Way, i.e.
less than 15 times the width of the image shown. In this colour composite, the
foreground stars in the Milky Way mostly appear as whitish spots (the “crosses”
around some of the brighter stars are caused by reflections in the telescope
optics). Many background galaxies are also seen. They form a huge cluster (ACO
3627) with a number of bright galaxies near the center — they stand out by their
larger size and yellowish colour. In order to facilitate transport over the Web,
this image has been compressed by a factor of four from its original size (8500
x 8250 pixels). North is up and East is left. Five exposures each were made in
blue (B-band filter; 5 x 300 sec), red (R-band filter; 5 x 180 sec) and
near-infrared (narrow-band filter centered at 816 nm; 5 x 240 sec) light and
combined into a false-colour composite by using blue, green, and red colour for
the three images, respectively. A logarithmic intensity scale is used to better
show the inner as well as the outer regions of the galaxies in this field.

text> This image displays part of a sky field centered on the distant cluster of
galaxies Abell 496, as imaged by the WFI at the 2.2-m MPG/ESO telescope at La
Silla during a total exposure time of just over 2 hours. Note in particular the
large numbers of very faint objects in this field, almost exclusively distant
galaxies. North is up and East is left in both photos. The WFI image of Abell
496 was obtained in blue light (B-band) and corresponds to a total integration
time of 7560 seconds, split into a number of exposures lasting between 600 and
1200 seconds. The faintest objects just detectable in this image have a
B-magnitude of about 26.5.

text> The Helix Nebula (also known as The Helix, NGC 7293, or Caldwell 63) is a
large planetary nebula (PN) located in the constellation Aquarius. Discovered by
Karl Ludwig Harding, probably before 1824, this object is one of the closest to
the Earth of all the bright planetary nebulae. The estimated distance is about
215 parsecs or 700 light-years. It is similar in appearance to the Ring Nebula,
whose size, age, and physical characteristics are similar to the Dumbbell
Nebula, varying only in its relative proximity and the appearance from the
equatorial viewing angle. The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the
“Eye of God” in pop culture.

text> Located about 15 million light-years away towards the Hydra (the sea
serpent) constellation, Messier 83 is a nearby face-on barred spiral with a
classic grand design form. It is the main member of a small galactic group
including NGC 5253 and about 9 dwarf galaxies. Messier 83 stretches over 40,000
light-years, making it roughly 2.5 times smaller than our own Milky Way.
However, in some respects, Messier 83 is quite similar to our own galaxy. Both
the Milky Way and Messier 83 possess a bar across their galactic nucleus, the
dense spherical conglomeration of stars seen at the centre of the galaxies.
Messier 83 has been a prolific producer of supernovae, with six observed in the
past century. This is indicative of an exceptionally high rate of star formation
coinciding with its classification as a starburst galaxy. Despite its symmetric
appearance, the central 1,000 light-years of the galaxy shows an unusually high
level of complexity, containing both a double nucleus and a double circumnuclear
starburst ring. The nature of the double nucleus is uncertain but the off centre
nucleus could be a remnant core of a small galaxy that merged with Messier 83 in
the past. The star clusters in the nuclear starburst rings are mostly young
stars between 5 and 10 million years old. This image is based on data acquired
with the 1.5-metre Danish telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile,
through three filters (B, V, R).

text> In this dazzling image, the galaxy NGC 1427A is seen as it travels through
the Fornax cluster of galaxies, to which it belongs. NGC 1427A is an example of
a dwarf irregular galaxy, a type of galaxy that is significantly less bright
than regular galaxies and characterised by a peculiar shape. In this particular
case, the shape of the galaxy has been forged by its rapid, upwards motion
through the cluster: with a speed of two million kilometres per hour relative to
the cluster, NCG 1427A is being torn apart and will eventually be disrupted. The
interaction with the Fornax cluster has led to the birth of many stars, seen
here as a boomerang-shaped region of young, glowing stars in the galaxy. NGC
1427A exhibits a striking resemblance to one of our galactic neighbours, the
Large Magellanic Cloud, which has undergone similar episodes of star formation,
triggered by its interaction with the Milky Way. This image has been obtained
using the FORS instrument mounted on one of the 8.2-metre telescopes of ESO’s
Very Large Telescope on top of Cerro Paranal, Chile. It combines data acquired
through four broadband filters (U, B, V, I) and a narrowband one (H-alpha).

text> Glowing in the cosmos at a distance of about 50 million light-years away,
the galaxy NGC 936 bears a striking resemblance to the Twin Ion Engine (TIE)
starfighters used by the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader and his crew in the epic
motion picture Star Wars. The galaxy’s shiny bulge and a bar-like structure
crossing it bring to mind the central engine and cockpit of the spacecraft;
while a ring of stars surrounding the galactic core completes the parallel,
corresponding to the wings of the TIE fighters that are equipped with solar
panels. This galaxy harbours exclusively old stars and shows no sign of any
recent star formation. Bars such as that observed in NGC 936 are common features
of galaxies; however, this one is significantly more marked than average.
Although a perfect symbol for the dark side of the “Force”, it is still
debatable whether this galaxy is dominated, like most others, by a large amount
of dark matter. This image has been obtained using the FORS instrument mounted
on one of the 8.2-metre telescopes of ESO’s Very Large Telescope on top of Cerro
Paranal, Chile. It combines data acquired through four wide-band filters (B, V,
R, I). The field of view is about 7 arcminutes.

text> NGC 5189 is a planetary nebula with an oriental twist. Similar in
appearance to a Chinese dragon, these red and green cosmic fireworks are the
last swansong of a dying star. At the end of its life, a star with a mass less
than eight times that of the Sun will blow its outer layers away, giving rise to
a planetary nebula. Some of these stellar puffballs are almost round, resembling
huge soap bubbles or giant planets (hence the name), but others, such as NGC
5189 are more intricate. In particular, this planetary nebula exhibits a curious
“S”-shaped profile, with a central bar that is most likely the projection of an
inner ring of gas discharged by the star, seen edge on. The details of the
physical processes producing such a complex symmetry from a simple, spherical
star are still the object of astronomical controversy. One possibility is that
the star has a very close (but unseen) companion. Over time the orbits drift due
to precession and this could result in the complex curves on the opposite sides
of the star visible in this image. This image has been taken with the New
Technology Telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile, using the now
decommissioned EMMI instrument. It is a combination of exposures taken through
different narrowband filters, each designed to catch only the light coming from
the glow of a given chemical element, namely hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.

cluster Pismis 24 blazes from the core of NGC 6357, a nebula in the
constellation of Scorpius (the Scorpion). Several stars in the clusters weigh in
at over 100 times the mass of the Sun, making them real monster stars. The
strange shapes taken by the clouds are a result of the huge amount of blazing
radiation emitted by these massive, hot stars. The gas and dust of the nebula
hide huge baby stars in the nebula from telescopes observing in visible light,
as well as adding to the hazy appearance of the image. This image combines

text> Gas and dust condense, beginning the process of creating new stars in this
image of Messier 8, also known as the Lagoon Nebula. Located four to five
thousand light-years away, in the constellation of Sagittarius (the Archer), the
nebula is a giant interstellar cloud, one hundred light-years across. It boasts
many large, hot stars, whose ultraviolet radiation sculpts the gas and dust into
unusual shapes. Two of these giant stars illuminate the brightest part of the
nebula, known as the Hourglass Nebula, a spiralling, funnel-like shape near its
centre. Messier 8 is one of the few star-forming nebulae visible to the unaided
eye, and was discovered as long ago as 1747, although the full range of colours
wasn’t visible until the advent of more powerful telescopes. The Lagoon Nebula
derives its name from the wide lagoon-shaped dark lane located in the middle of
the nebula that divides it into two glowing sections. This image combines
observations performed through three different filters (B, V, R) with the
1.5-metre Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile.

text> NGC 6118, a grand-design spiral galaxy, shines bright in this image,
displaying its central bar and tight spiral arms from its home in the
constellation of Serpens (The Snake). The galaxy is sometimes known to amateur
astronomers as the “Blinking Galaxy” because this relatively faint, fuzzy object
would appear to flick into existence when viewed through their telescopes in a
certain orientation, and then suddenly disappear again as the eye position
shifted. The brilliant blue star-forming regions of the galaxy, where hot young
stars are born, are beautifully illuminated, even from over 80 million
light-years away. In 2004, regular observers of this galaxy saw a “new star”
appear near the edge of the galaxy (above the centre of the image). Far from
being a new star, this object, supernova 2004dk, is in fact the final, powerful
burst of light emitted by the explosion of a star. Though shy to lesser
telescopes, the galaxy cannot hide from ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at
Cerro Paranal, Chile. The image was obtained using the VIsible MultiObject
Spectrograph (VIMOS) at the VLT.

text> NGC 3628 is a spiral galaxy and a member of a small, but conspicuous group
of galaxies located about 35 million light-years away, toward the constellation
of Leo (the Lion). The other distinguished members of this family, known
collectively as the Leo Triplet, are two well-known prominent spiral galaxies,
Messier 65 and Messier 66 (not seen on the image), which were both discovered in
1780 by famous French comet hunter Charles Messier. NGC 3628 is the faintest of
the trio and escaped Messier’s observations with his rather small telescope. It
was discovered and catalogued by William Herschel only four years later. NGC
3628 hides its spiral structure because it is seen perfectly edge-on, exactly as
we observe the Milky Way on a clear night. Its most distinctive feature is a
dark band of dust that lies across the plane of the disc and which is visibly
distorted outwards, as a consequence of the gravitational interaction between
NGC 3628 and its bullying companions. This boxy or “peanut-shaped” bulge, seen
as a faint X-shape, is formed mainly of young stars and gas and dust, which
create the bulge away from the plane of the rest of the galaxy through their
powerful motions. Because of its appearance, NGC 3628 was catalogued as Arp 317
in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies, published in 1966, which aimed to
characterise a large sample of odd objects that fell outside the standard Hubble
classification, to aid understanding of how galaxies evolve. The depth of the
image reveals a myriad of galaxies of different shapes and colours, some of
which lie much further away than NGC 3628. Particularly noticeable is the fuzzy
blob just in the centre of the image, which is a diffuse satellite galaxy. A
number of globular clusters can be seen as fuzzy reddish spots in the halo of
the galaxy. Also visible as bright spots near the lower edge of the image (the
two blue star-like objects below the satellite galaxy) are two quasars, the
central engines of distant and very energetic galaxies, billions of light-years
away. This image has been taken with the FORS2 instrument, attached to one of
the ESO Very Large Telescope’s Unit Telescopes. It is a combination of exposures
taken through different filters (B, V and R), for a total exposure time of just
below one hour. The field of view is about 7 arcminutes across, which is why
this large galaxy does not fit into the image. Links Image of Messier 66

text> NGC 4027, also known as Arp 22, stretches its single extended spiral arm
in this face-on image. Located about 75 million light-years away in the
constellation of Corvus (the Crow), this barred spiral galaxy is identified as a
peculiar galaxy by this extended arm, thought to be the result of a collision
with another galaxy millions of years ago — most likely a small galaxy known as
NGC 4027A. NGC 4027 is part of the NGC 4038 Group, a group of galaxies that also
contains the famous distorted couple known as the Antennae Galaxies (see eso0209
and heic0615). This image is based on data collected with the ESO Faint Object
Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC) attached to the 3.58-metre New Technology
Telescope (NTT) at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. The data were
collected through three broadband filters (B, V and R) and two narrowband
filters (Hα and doubly ionised oxygen).

text> Haro 11 appears to shine gently amid clouds of gas and dust, but this
placid facade belies the monumental rate of star formation occurring in this
“starburst” galaxy. By combining data from ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have created a new image of this
incredibly bright and distant galaxy. The team of astronomers from Stockholm
University, Sweden, and the Geneva Observatory, Switzerland, have identified 200
separate clusters of very young, massive stars. Most of these are less than 10
million years old. Many of the clusters are so bright in infrared light that
astronomers suspect that the stars are still emerging from the cloudy cocoons
where they were born. The observations have led the astronomers to conclude that
Haro 11 is most likely the result of a merger between a galaxy rich in stars and
a younger, gas-rich galaxy. Haro 11 is found to produce stars at a frantic rate,
converting about 20 solar masses of gas into stars every year. Haro galaxies,
first discovered by the noted astronomer Guillermo Haro in 1956, are defined by
unusually intense blue and violet light. Usually this high energy radiation
comes from the presence of many newborn stars or an active galactic nucleus.
Haro 11 is about 300 million light-years away and is the second closest of such
starburst galaxies. The paper describing this result (“Super star clusters in
Haro 11: Properties of a very young starburst and evidence for a near-infrared
flux excess”, by A. Adamo et al.) is available at
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16983.x

text> NGC 5426 and NGC 5427 are two spiral galaxies of similar sizes engaged in
a dramatic dance. It is not certain that this interaction will end in a
collision and ultimately a merging of the two galaxies, although the galaxies
have already been affected. Together known as Arp 271, this dance will last for
tens of millions of years, creating new stars as a result of the mutual
gravitational attraction between the galaxies, a pull seen in the bridge of
stars already connecting the two. Located 90 million light-years away towards
the constellation of Virgo (the Virgin), the Arp 271 pair is about 130 000
light-years across. It was originally discovered in 1785 by William Herschel.
Quite possibly, our own Milky Way will undergo a similar collision in about five
billion years with the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy, which is now located about
2.6 million light-years away from the Milky Way. This image was taken with the
EFOSC instrument, attached to the 3.58-metre New Technology Telescope at ESO’s
La Silla Observatory in Chile. The data were acquired through three different
filters (B, V, and R) for a total exposure time of 4440 seconds. The field of
view is about 4 arcminutes.

text> Spiralling around, 61 million light-years away in the constellation Fornax
(the Furnace), NGC 1365 is enormous. At 200000 light-years across, it is one of
the largest galaxies known to astronomers. This, plus the sharply defined bar of
old stars across its structure is why it is also known as the Great Barred
Spiral Galaxy. Astronomers think that the Milky Way may look very similar to
this galaxy, but at half the size. The bright centre of the galaxy is thought to
be due to huge amounts of superhot gas ejected from the ring of material
circling a central black hole. Young luminous hot stars, born out of the
interstellar clouds, give the arms a prominent appearance and a blue colour. The
bar and spiral pattern rotates, with one full turn taking about 350 million
years. This image combines observations performed through three different
filters (B, V, R) with the 1.5-metre Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla
Observatory in Chile.

text> Among the myriad of stars in this image shines NGC 2257, a collection of
cosmic gems bound tightly by gravity. Many billions of years old, but still
sparkling brightly, it is an eye-catching astronomical object. NGC 2257 is a
globular cluster, the name given to the roughly spherical concentrations of
stars that orbit galactic cores, but are often found far out from the centres in
the halo areas of galaxies. Globular clusters contain very old stars, being
typically over 10 billion years old, and can therefore be used like a “fossil
record” to learn more about the Universe’s past. They are densely packed, with
tens to hundreds of thousands of stars gathered within a diameter of just a few
tens of light-years. NGC 2257 lies on the outskirts of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way. It is one of 15 very old
globular clusters in the LMC. The image is made from data taken with the Wide
Field Imager instrument on the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla, in B, V
and I filters, which are shown here in blue, green and red respectively. The
field of view is approximately 20 by 20 arcminutes. These observations were made
as part of the ESO Imaging Survey project, which was planned to make public
imaging surveys to identify targets for follow-up observations with the Very
Large Telescope. Links ESO Imaging Survey

text> The centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is again in the sights of ESO
telescopes. This time it’s the turn of ISAAC, the VLT’s near- and mid-infrared
spectrometer and camera. From Chile’s Atacama Desert, site of the ESO
observatories, the Milky Way offers magnificent views, particularly in the
southern hemisphere winter, when the central region of our galaxy is most
visible (see eso0934). However, the Galactic Centre itself, located about 27 000
light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius, hides behind thick clouds
of interstellar dust, which appear as dark obscuring lanes in visible light, but
which are transparent at longer wavelengths such as the infrared. In this image,
the infrared observations clearly reveal the dense clustering of stars in the
galactic core. ESO telescopes have been tracking stars orbiting the centre of
the Milky Way for more than 18 years, getting the highest resolution images of
this area and providing a definitive proof of the existence of a supermassive
black hole in the heart of our galaxy (read more in eso0226 and eso0846).
Infrared flashes emitted by hot gas falling into the supermassive black hole
have also been detected with ESO telescopes (see eso0330). This
representative-colour picture is composed of images taken by ISAAC at
near-infrared wavelengths through 2.25, 2.09, and 1.71 µm narrowband filters
(shown in red, green and blue respectively). It covers a field of view of 2.5
arcminutes.

text> NGC 520 — also known as Arp 157 — looks like a galaxy in the midst of
exploding. In reality, it’s the exact opposite. Two enormous spiral galaxies are
crashing into each other, melding and forming a new conglomerate. This happens
slowly, over millions of years — the whole process started some 300 million
years ago. The object, about 100 000 light-years across, is now in the middle
stage of the merging process, as the two nuclei haven’t merged yet, but the two
discs have. The merger features a tail of stars and a prominent dust lane. NGC
520 is one of the brightest interacting galaxies in the sky and lies in the
direction of Pisces (the Fish), approximately 100 million light-years from
Earth. This image was taken by the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera
attached to the 3.6-metre telescope at La Silla in Chile. It is based on data
obtained through B, V, R and H-alpha filters.

text> The HAWK-I instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal
Observatory in Chile has been used to great effect in producing this distinctive
image of the distant galaxy NGC 157. Boasting a central sweep of stars
resembling a giant “S”, reminiscent of the comic book hero Superman’s symbol,
this celestial spiral is indeed a super example of how new technology is helping
us to learn more about the cosmos. HAWK-I stands for High-Acuity Wide-field
K-band Imager, and it is one of the latest and most powerful instruments on the
VLT. It detects infrared light, allowing us to peer through the gas and dust
that normally obscures our view. This reveals an otherwise hidden view of the
Universe, and gives astronomers the opportunity to study dense areas of star
formation. Learning more about star formation is an important step towards
expanding our understanding of our own origins. The same processes that are
coalescing material in NGC 157 and creating stars there took place around 4.5
billion years ago in the Milky Way to form our own star, the Sun. NGC 157 is
faint at about magnitude 11, but can be tracked down by dedicated amateur
astronomers. It is located within the constellation of Cetus (the Sea Monster).

text> This rich scattering of galaxies was captured using the Wide Field Imager
attached to the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in
Chile. The thousands of galaxies contained in this small area of sky give a
glimpse into the Universe’s distant past, whilst also acting as a powerful
reminder of the immense scale of the cosmos. This image was taken as part of the
COMBO-17 project (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17
Filters), in which detailed surveys of five small patches of sky were made
through 17 different coloured filters. The area of sky covered by each of the
five regions is about the same area as that covered by the full Moon. The survey
has produced a remarkable haul of celestial specimens. For example, across just
three of these regions over 25 000 galaxies have been identified. Just below the
bright stars in the centre of the image is the galaxy cluster Abell 226. It was
first noted by astronomer George Ogden Abell in his catalogue of galaxy clusters
of 1958. The galaxies in Abell’s clusters, including Abell 226, are only up to a
few billion light-years away. But behind these objects, even fainter, more
distant galaxies were hiding. The COMBO-17 study has unveiled these hidden
galaxies, thanks to long exposure images from the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at
ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile. Some of the most distant flecks of light
visible in this photo represent galaxies whose light has been travelling towards
us for about nine or ten billion years. That means that the galaxies in this
image have a great variety of ages, some of them are quite similar to the Milky
Way, while others reveal what the Universe was like when it was much younger.
This image was taken using three of the 17 filters from the study: B (in blue),
V (in green), and R (in red). Links COMBO-17 at the Max Planck Institute for

text> This new image of the spiral galaxy NGC 3244 was taken with the help of
the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, during his visit to ESO’s
Paranal Observatory [1], on the night of 6 April 2011. The Czech Republic joined
ESO in 2007, and this was the first visit of the country’s President to an ESO
site. This galaxy has attracted considerable interest from astronomers over the
past nine months, thanks to the violent death of one of its stars, which was
discovered on 27 June 2010. This supernova explosion, now known as Supernova
2010ev (SN 2010ev), is still visible as the — now faint — blue dot nestled
within one of the thick spiral arms just to the left of the galaxy’s nucleus. To
the right of the galaxy, an unremarkable foreground star in our own Milky Way,
TYC 7713-527-1, shines brightly enough to catch our attention. Although the star
seems a great deal brighter than SN 2010ev, this is actually an illusion created
by the large difference in the distances of the two objects. The galaxy is much
further away, at a distance of about 90 million light years, while the star lies
thousands of times closer, within our own galaxy. At its brightest, SN 2010ev
reached an apparent magnitude of about 14, making it about 1000 times dimmer
than the naked eye can see, but it was still the third brightest supernova
observed in 2010. In fact, if the supernova had been as close to Earth as TYC
7713-527-1, it would have been easily visible to the naked eye, unlike the
aforementioned star. The image was taken using the FORS2 instrument on the ESO
Very Large Telescope (VLT). The filters used for the image were B, V and R,
which were coloured blue, green and red respectively. A framed print of the
President’s Galaxy has been presented to Václav Klaus, as a memento of his visit
to Paranal. Notes [1] For more information about the visit of the President of
the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, see the organisation release Links Read more

text> It’s one of the closest galaxies to Earth, but the Carina Dwarf Galaxy is
so dim and diffuse that astronomers only discovered it in the 1970s. A companion
galaxy of the Milky Way, this ball of stars shares features with both globular
star clusters and much larger galaxies. Astronomers believe that dwarf
spheroidal galaxies like the Carina Dwarf are very common in the Universe, but
they are extremely difficult to observe. Their faintness and low star density
mean that it is easy to simply see right through them. In this image, the Carina
Dwarf appears as many faint stars scattered across most of the central part of
the picture. It is hard to tell apart stars from the dwarf galaxy, foreground
stars within the Milky Way and even faraway galaxies that poke through the gaps:
the Carina Dwarf is a master of cosmic camouflage. The Carina Dwarf’s stars show
an unusual spread of ages. They appear to have formed in a series of bursts,
with quiet periods lasting several billion years in between them. It lies around
300 000 light-years from Earth, which places it further away than the Magellanic
Clouds (the nearest galaxies to the Milky Way), but significantly closer to us
than the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest spiral galaxy. So, despite being small
for a galaxy, its proximity to Earth means that the Carina Dwarf appears quite
large in the sky, just under half the size of the full Moon — albeit very much
fainter. This makes it fit comfortably within the field of view of ESO’s Wide
Field Imager, an instrument designed for making observations of large parts of
the sky. Although this image in itself is not so striking, it is likely the best
image of the Carina Dwarf Galaxy to date. The image was made using observations
from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla, and
from the Victor M. Blanco 4-metre telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory.

text> Two galaxies, about 50 million light-years away, are locked in a galactic
embrace — literally. The Seyfert galaxy NGC 1097, in the constellation of Fornax
(The Furnace), is seen in this image taken with the VIMOS instrument on ESO’s
Very Large Telescope (VLT). A comparatively tiny elliptical companion galaxy,
NGC 1097A, is also visible in the top left. There is evidence that NGC 1097 and
NGC 1097A have been interacting in the recent past. Although NGC 1097 seems to
be wrapping its companion in its spiral arms, this is no gentle motherly giant.
The larger galaxy also has four faint jets — too extended and faint to be seen
in this image — that emerge from its centre, forming an X-shaped pattern, and
which are the longest visible-wavelength jets of any known galaxy. The jets are
thought to be the remnants of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and cannibalised
by the much larger NGC 1097 up to a few billion years ago. These unusual jets
are not the galaxy’s only intriguing feature. As previously mentioned, NGC 1097
is a Seyfert galaxy, meaning that it contains a supermassive black hole in its
centre. However, the core of NGC 1097 is relatively faint, suggesting that the
central black hole is not currently swallowing large quantities of gas and
stars. Instead, the most striking feature of the galaxy’s centre is the ring of
bright knots surrounding the nucleus. These knots are thought to be large
bubbles of glowing hydrogen gas about 750–2500 light-years across, ionised by
the intense ultraviolet light of young stars, and they indicate that the ring is
a site of vigorous star formation With this distinctive central star-forming
ring, and the addition of numerous bluish clusters of hot, young stars dotted
through its spiral arms, NGC 1097 makes a stunning visual object. The data were
originally taken in 2004 (see eso0438) with the VIMOS instrument on the VLT, and
additional colour information from an image taken by amateur astronomer Robert
Gendler has been superimposed. The VLT data were taken through three
visible-light filters: R (at a wavelength of 652 nanometres, and shown here in
red), V (a wavelength of 540 nanometres, shown in green), and B (456 nanometres,
shown in blue). The image covers a region of approximately 7.7 x 6.6 arcminutes
on the sky.

text> The hazy and aptly named Fine Ring Nebula, shown here, is an unusual
planetary nebula. Planetary nebulae form when some dying stars, having expanded
into a red giant phase, expel a shell of gas as they evolve into white dwarfs.
Most planetary nebulae are either spherical or elliptical in shape, or bipolar
(featuring two symmetric lobes of material). But the Fine Ring Nebula — captured
here by the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera mounted on the New
Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile — looks like an almost
perfect circular ring. Astronomers believe that some of these more unusually
shaped planetary nebulae are formed when the progenitor star is actually a
binary system. The interaction between the primary star and its orbiting
companion shapes the ejected material. The stellar object at the centre of the
Fine Ring Nebula is indeed thought to be a binary system, orbiting with a period
of 2.9 days. Observations suggest that the binary pair is almost perfectly
face-on from our vantage point, implying that the planetary nebula’s structure
is aligned in the same way. We are looking down on a torus (doughnut shape) of
ejected material, leading to the strikingly circular ring shape in the image.
Planetary nebulae are shaped by the complex interplay of many physical
processes. Not only can these celestial objects be admired for their beauty, but
the study of precisely how they form their striking shapes is a fascinating

text> A new Very Large Telescope (VLT) image of the Antennae Galaxies gives us
what may be the second-best visible-light view yet of this striking pair of
colliding galaxies with dramatically distorted shapes. This amazing object takes
its name from the long antenna-like “arms” extending far out from the nuclei of
the two galaxies, best seen in wider-field images by ground-based telescopes
such as the one at this link. This VLT view focuses instead on the galaxies’
nuclei, where the real action is taking place as the two galaxies merge into a
single giant galaxy. Spurred by shock waves created by their gravitational
wrestling, the two galaxies have become dotted with brilliant blue hot young
stars in star-forming regions, surrounded by glowing hydrogen gas, shown here in
pink. The two pale yellow blobs are the cores of the original galaxies, shining
with the light of old stars and picked out by delicate lanes of dust. The
Antennae Galaxies were immortalised in 2006 by one of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
Telescope’s most famous images (composed by ESA’s Hubble group residing at ESO).
If you are hungry for more information about this amazing object, read the
just-published ESO press release about the first image from ALMA, the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, which has just started its Early Science
observations. ALMA , constructed by ESO and its international partners, observes
the Universe in light with millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths — radically
different from visible-light and infrared telescopes. ALMA’s view is the best
submillimetre-wavelength image ever made of the Antennae Galaxies, despite being
just a taster of what ALMA will deliver. The ALMA image was made using test data
from only twelve antennas, and as the observatory grows, the sharpness,
efficiency, and quality of its observations will increase dramatically. This
image was processed by ESO using the observational data found by Alberto Milani
(Italy), who submitted it to ESO’s “Your ESO Pictures” Flickr group.

text> Not all spiral galaxies have to be picture-perfect to be striking. Messier
96, also known as NGC 3368, is a case in point: its core is displaced from the
centre, its gas and dust are distributed asymmetrically and its spiral arms are
ill-defined. But this portrait, taken with the FORS1 instrument on ESO’s Very
Large Telescope, shows that imperfection is beauty in Messier 96. The galaxy’s
core is compact but glowing, and the dark dust lanes around it move in a
delicate swirl towards the nucleus. And the spiral arms, patchy rings of young
blue stars, are like necklaces of blue pearls. Messier 96 lies in the
constellation of Leo (The Lion). It is the largest galaxy in the Leo I group of
galaxies; including its outermost spiral arms, it spans some 100 000 light-years
in diameter — about the size of our Milky Way. Its graceful imperfections likely
result from the gravitational pull of other members in the group, or are perhaps
due to past galactic encounters. A multitude of background galaxies peers
through the dusty spiral. Perhaps the most striking of these objects is an
edge-on galaxy that — because of a chance alignment — appears to interrupt the
outermost spiral arm to the upper left of Messier 96’s core. This image was
processed by ESO using the observational data found by Oleg Maliy from Ukraine,
who participated in ESO’s Hidden Treasures 2010 astrophotography competition
[1], organised in October–November 2010, for everyone who enjoys making
beautiful images of the night sky using astronomical data obtained with
professional telescopes. The image was made with data taken at visible and
infrared wavelengths through B, V, and I filters. Notes [1] ESO’s Hidden
Treasures 2010 competition gave amateur astronomers the opportunity to search
through ESO’s vast archives of astronomical data, hoping to find a well-hidden
gem that needed polishing by the entrants. To find out more about Hidden
Treasures, visit http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/hiddentreasures/.

text> This image, from ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), shows a truly
remarkable galaxy known as NGC 3621. To begin with, it is a pure-disc galaxy.
Like other spirals, it has a flat disc permeated by dark lanes of material and
with prominent spiral arms where young stars are forming in clusters (the blue
dots seen in the image). But while most spiral galaxies have a central bulge — a
large group of old stars packed in a compact, spheroidal region — NGC 3621
doesn’t. In this image, it is clear that there is simply a brightening to the
centre, but no actual bulge like the one in NGC 6744 (eso1118), for example. NGC
3621 is also interesting as it is believed to have an active supermassive black
hole at its centre that is engulfing matter and producing radiation. This is
somewhat unusual because most of these so-called active galactic nuclei exist in
galaxies with prominent bulges. In this particular case, the supermassive black
hole is thought to have a relatively small mass, of around 20 000 times that of
the Sun. Another interesting feature is that there are also thought to be two
smaller black holes, with masses of a few thousand times that of the Sun, near
the nucleus of the galaxy. Therefore, NGC 3621 is an extremely interesting
object which, despite not having a central bulge, has a system of three black
holes in its central region. This galaxy is located in the constellation of
Hydra (The Sea Snake) and can be seen with a moderate-sized telescope. This
image, taken using B, V, and I filters with the FORS1 instrument on the powerful
VLT, shows striking detail in this odd object and also reveals a multitude of
background galaxies. A number of bright foreground stars that belong to our own
Milky Way are also visible.

text> The picture is part of the COMBO-17 survey (Classifying Objects by
Medium-Band Observations in 17 Filters), a project dedicated to recording
detailed images of small patches of the sky through filters of 17 different
colours. The area covered in this image is only about the size of the full Moon,
but thousands of galaxies can be identified just within this small region. The
image was taken with an exposure time of almost seven hours, which allowed the
camera to capture the light from very faint and distant objects, as well as
those that are closer to us. Galaxies with clear and regular structures, such as
the spiral specimen viewed edge-on near the upper left corner, are only up to a
few billion light-years away. The fainter, fuzzier objects are so far away that
it has taken nine or ten billion years for their light to reach us. The COMBO-17
survey is a powerful tool for studying the distribution of dark matter in
galaxies. Dark matter is a mysterious substance that does not emit or absorb
light and can only be detected by its gravitational pull on other objects. Some
of the closer galaxies pictured act as lenses that distort the light coming from
more distant galaxies placed along the same line of sight. By measuring this
distortion, an effect known as gravitational lensing, astronomers are able to
understand how dark matter is distributed in the objects that act as lenses. The
distortion is weak and, therefore, almost imperceptible to the human eye.
However, because surveying the sky with 17 filters allows extremely precise
distance measurements, it is possible to determine if two galaxies that appear
to lie close to each other are actually at very different distances from the
Earth. After identifying the galactic lensing systems, the distortion can be
measured by averaging over thousands of galaxies. With more than 4000 galactic
lenses identified, this COMBO-17 survey is an ideal method to help astronomers
to understand the dark matter better. This image was taken with three of the 17
filters from the project: B (blue), V (green), and R (red). Data through an
additional near-infrared filter was also used. Links COMBO-17 at the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy

text> This image shows the swirling shape of galaxy NGC 2217, in the
constellation of Canis Major (The Great Dog). In the central region of the
galaxy is a distinctive bar of stars within an oval ring. Further out, a set of
tightly wound spiral arms almost form a circular ring around the galaxy. NGC
2217 is therefore classified as a barred spiral galaxy, and its circular
appearance indicates that we see it nearly face-on. The outer spiral arms have a
bluish colour, indicating the presence of hot, luminous, young stars, born out
of clouds of interstellar gas. The central bulge and bar are yellower in
appearance, due to the presence of older stars. Dark streaks can also be seen in
places against the galaxy’s arms and central bulge, where lanes of cosmic dust
block out some of the starlight. The majority of spiral galaxies in the local
Universe — including our own Milky Way — are thought to have a bar of some kind,
and these structures play an important role in the development of a galaxy. They
can, for example, funnel gas towards the centre of the galaxy, helping to feed a
central black hole, or to form new stars.

text> The Very Large Telescope has captured another member of the Leo I group of
galaxies, in the constellation of Leo (The Lion). The galaxy Messier 95 stands
boldly face-on, offering an ideal view of its spiral structure. The spiral arms
form an almost perfect circle around the galactic centre before they spread out,
creating a mane-like effect of which any lion would be proud. Another, perhaps
even more striking, feature of Messier 95 is its blazing golden core. It
contains a nuclear star-forming ring, almost 2000 light-years across, where a
large proportion of the galaxy’s star formation takes place. This phenomenon
occurs mostly in barred spiral galaxies such as Messier 95 and our home, the
Milky Way. In the Leo I group, Messier 95 is outshone by its brother Messier 96
(see potw1143). Messier 96 is in fact the brightest member of the group and — as
“leader of the pride” — also gives Leo I its alternative name of the M 96 group.
Nevertheless, Messier 95 also makes for a spectacular image. Stop press! By
coincidence Messier 95 is the host of a probable supernova that was first
spotted on 17 March 2012. Discovery details are here. And as another coincidence
both supernova and galaxy are currently very close to the brilliant planet Mars
amongst the stars of Leo. Please note that the observations used to make this
Picture of the Week were taken before the supernova occurred, and therefore the
supernova itself does not appear in this image.

text> The Cat’s Paw Nebula is revisited in a combination of exposures from the
MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope and expert amateur astronomers Robert Gendler and
Ryan M. Hannahoe. The distinctive shape of the nebula is revealed in reddish
puffy clouds of glowing gas against a dark sky dotted with stars. The image was
made by combining existing observations from the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope of
the La Silla Observatory in Chile (see ESO Photo Release eso1003) with 60 hours
of exposures on a 0.4-metre telescope taken by Gendler and Hannahoe. The
resolution of the existing 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope observations was combined
(by using their “luminance” or brightness) with the colour information from
Gendler and Hannahoe’s observations to produce a beautiful combination of data
from amateur and professional telescopes. For example, the additional colour
information brings out the faint blue nebulosity in the central region, which is
not seen in the original ESO image, while the ESO data contribute their finer
detail. The result is an image that is much more than the sum of its parts. The
well-named Cat’s Paw Nebula (also known as NGC 6334) lies in the constellation
of Scorpius (The Scorpion). Although it appears close to the centre of the Milky
Way on the sky, it is relatively near to Earth, at a distance of about 5500
light-years. It is about 50 light-years across and is one of the most active
star formation regions in our galaxy, containing massive, young brilliant blue
stars, which have formed in the last few million years. It is host to possibly
tens of thousands of stars in total, some of them visible and others still
hidden in the clouds of gas and dust. Links Robert Gendler’s website

text> On Earth, cocoons are associated with new life. There are “cocoons” in
space too, but, rather than protecting pupae as they transform into moths, they
are the birthplaces of new stars. The red cloud seen in this image, taken with
the EFOSC2 instrument on ESO’s New Technology Telescope, is a perfect example of
one of these star-forming regions. This is a view of a cloud called RCW 88,
which is located about ten thousand light-years away and is about nine
light-years across. It is not made of silk, like a moth’s cocoon, but of glowing
hydrogen gas that surrounds the recently formed stars. The new stars form from
clouds of this hydrogen gas as they collapse under their own gravity. Some of
the more developed stars, already shining brightly, can even be seen peering
through the cloud. These hot young stars are very energetic and emit large
amounts of ultraviolet radiation, which strips the electrons from the hydrogen
atoms in the cloud, leaving the positively charged nuclei — protons. As the
electrons are recaptured by the protons, they can emit H-alpha light, which has
a characteristic red glow. Observing the sky through an H-alpha filter is the
easiest way for astronomers to find these star-forming regions. A dedicated
H-alpha filter was one of the four filters used to produce this image.

text> This colourful new view shows the star-forming region LHA 120-N44 [1] in
the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. This
picture combines the view in visible light from the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope
at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile with images in infrared light and X-rays
from orbiting satellite observatories. At the centre of this very rich region of
gas, dust and young stars lies the star cluster NGC 1929. Its massive stars
produce intense radiation, expel matter at high speeds as stellar winds, and
race through their short but brilliant lives to explode as supernovae. The winds
and supernova shock waves have carved out a huge cavity, called a superbubble,
in the surrounding gas. Observations with NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory
(shown here in blue) reveal hot regions created by these winds and shocks, while
infrared data from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope (shown in red) outline where
the dust and cooler gas are found. The visible-light view from the MPG/ESO
2.2-metre telescope (in yellow) completes the picture and shows the hot young
stars themselves as well as the glowing clouds of gas and dust that surround
them. Combining these different views of this dramatic region has allowed
astronomers to solve a mystery: why are N44, and similar superbubbles, giving
off such strong X-rays? The answer seems to be that there are two extra sources
of bright X-ray emission: supernova shock waves striking the walls of the
cavities, and hot material evaporating from the cavity walls. This X-ray
emission from the edge of the superbubble shows up clearly in the picture. Links
NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope Notes [1] The
designation of this object indicates that it was included in the Catalogue of
H-alpha emission stars and nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds, compiled and
published in 1956 by American astronomer–astronaut Karl Henize (1926–1993). The
letter “N” indicates that it is a nebula. The object is often called simply N44.

text> IC 5148 is a beautiful planetary nebula located some 3000 light-years away
in the constellation of Grus (The Crane). The nebula has a diameter of a couple
of light-years, and it is still growing at over 50 kilometres per second — one
of the fastest expanding planetary nebulae known. The term “planetary nebula”
arose in the 19th century, when the first observations of such objects — through
the small telescopes available at the time — looked somewhat like giant planets.
However, the true nature of planetary nebulae is quite different. When a star
with a mass similar to or a few times more than that of our Sun approaches the
end of its life, its outer layers are thrown off into space. The expanding gas
is illuminated by the hot remaining core of the star at the centre, forming the
planetary nebula, which often takes on a beautiful, glowing shape. When observed
with a smaller amateur telescope, this particular planetary nebula shows up as a
ring of material, with the star — which will cool to become a white dwarf —
shining in the middle of the central hole. This appearance led astronomers to
nickname IC 5148 the Spare Tyre Nebula. The ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and
Camera (EFOSC2) on the New Technology Telescope at La Silla gives a somewhat
more elegant view of this object. Rather than looking like a spare tyre, the
nebula resembles ethereal blossom with layered petals.

text> This deep-field image shows what is known as a supercluster of galaxies —
a giant group of galaxy clusters which are themselves clustered together. This
one, known as Abell 901/902, comprises three separate main clusters and a number
of filaments of galaxies, typical of such super-structures. One cluster, Abell
901a, can be seen above and just to the right of the prominent red foreground
star near the middle of the image. Another, Abell 901b, is further to the right
of Abell 901a, and slightly lower. Finally, the cluster Abell 902 is directly
below the red star, towards the bottom of the image. The Abell 901/902
supercluster is located a little over two billion light-years from Earth, and
contains hundreds of galaxies in a region about 16 million light-years across.
For comparison, the Local Group of galaxies — which contains our Milky Way among
more than 50 others — measures roughly ten million light-years across. This
image was taken by the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre
telescope, located at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Using data from the WFI
and from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, in 2008 astronomers were able to
precisely map the distribution of dark matter in the supercluster, showing that
the clusters and individual galaxies which comprise the super-structure reside
within vast clumps of dark matter. To do this, astronomers looked at how the
light from 60 000 faraway galaxies located behind the supercluster was being
distorted by the gravitational influence of the dark matter it contains, thus
revealing its distribution. The mass of the four main dark matter clumps of
Abell 901/902 is thought to be around ten trillion times that of the Sun. The
observations shown here are part of the COMBO-17 survey, a survey of the sky
undertaken in 17 different optical filters using the WFI camera. The COMBO-17
project has so far found over 25 000 galaxies. Links The COMBO-17 survey at the

text> This image depicts the galaxy NGC 4535, in the constellation of Virgo (The
Maiden), on a beautiful background full of many distant faint galaxies. Its
almost circular appearance shows that we observe it nearly face-on. In the
centre of the galaxy, there is a well-defined bar structure, with dust lanes
that curve sharply before the spiral arms break from the ends of the bar. The
bluish colour of the spiral arms points to the presence of a large number of hot
young stars. In the centre, however, older and cooler stars give the bulge of
the galaxy a yellower appearance. This visible image was made with the FORS1
instrument on ESO’s 8.2-metre Very Large Telescope. The galaxy can also be seen
through smaller amateur telescopes, and was first observed by William Herschel
in 1785. When seen through a smaller telescope, NGC 4535 has a hazy, ghostly
appearance, which inspired the prominent amateur astronomer Leland S. Copeland
to name it “The Lost Galaxy” in the 1950s. NGC 4535 is one of the largest

about 50 million light-years away. Although the Virgo Cluster is not much larger
in diameter than the Local Group — the galaxy cluster to which the Milky Way
belongs — it contains almost fifty times as many galaxies.

text> Spiral galaxies are usually very aesthetically appealing objects, and
never more so than when they appear face-on. And this image is a particularly
splendid example: it is the grand design spiral galaxy Messier 100, located in
the southern part of the constellation of Coma Berenices, and lying about 55
million light-years from Earth. While Messier 100 shows very well defined spiral
arms, it also displays the faintest of bar-like structures in the centre, which
classifies this as type SAB. Although it is not easily spotted in the image,
scientists have been able to confirm the bar’s existence by observing it in
other wavelengths. This very detailed image shows the main features expected in
a galaxy of this type: huge clouds of hydrogen gas, glowing in red patches when
they re-emit the energy absorbed from newly born, massive stars; the uniform
brightness of older, yellowish stars near the centre; and black shreds of dust
weaving through the arms of the galaxy. Messier 100 is one of the brightest
members of the Virgo Cluster, which is the closest cluster of galaxies to our
galaxy, the Milky Way, containing over 2000 galaxies, including spirals,
ellipticals, and irregulars. This picture is a combination of images from the
FORS instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory in Chile,
taken with red (R), green (V) and blue (B) filters. Links Photos of the VLT

text> This beautiful image portrays the galaxies NGC 799 (below) and NGC 800
(above) located in the constellation of Cetus (The Whale). This pair of galaxies
was first observed by the American astronomer Lewis Swift back in 1885. Located
at a distance of about 300 million light-years, our face-on view allows us to
clearly appreciate their shapes. Like the Milky Way — our galaxy — these objects
are both spiral galaxies, with characteristic long arms winding towards a bright
bulge at the centre. In the prominent spiral arms, a large number of hot, young,
blue stars are forming in clusters (tiny blue dots seen in the image) whereas in
the central bulge a large group of cooler, redder, old stars are packed into a
compact, almost spherical region. At first glance, these galaxies look rather
similar, but the devil is in the detail. Apart from the obvious difference in
size, only NGC 799 has a bar structure, extending from its central bulge, and
the spiral arms wind out from the ends of the bar. Galactic bars are thought to
act as a mechanism that channels gas from the spiral arms to the centre,
intensifying star formation. A supernova was also observed in NGC 799 in 2004,
and was given the name SN2004dt. Another interesting differentiating feature is
the number of spiral arms. The small NGC 800 has three bright, knotty spiral
arms, whilst NGC 799 only has two relatively dim, but broad spiral arms. These
start at the end of the bar and wrap nearly completely around the galaxy forming
a structure that looks almost like a ring. While it might seem that this image
depicts two impressive close spiral galaxies coexisting in an everlasting peace,
nothing can be further than the truth. We could be just witnessing the calm
before the storm. We don’t know exactly what the future will bring, but
typically, when two galaxies are close enough, they interact over hundreds of
millions of years by means of gravitational disturbances. In some cases, only
minor interactions occur, causing shape distortions, but sometimes galaxies
collide, merging to form a single, new and larger galaxy. The image was obtained
using the FORS1 instrument on the 8.2-metre ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) atop
Cerro Paranal, Chile. It combines exposures taken through three filters (B, V,
R). Five asteroids can also be seen — can you find them all? The asteroids moved
between the different exposures leaving colourful streaks in the image.

a small part of the well-known emission nebula, NGC 6357, located some 8000
light-years away, in the tail of the southern constellation of Scorpius (The
Scorpion). The image glows with the characteristic red of an H II region, and
contains a large amount of ionised and excited hydrogen gas. The cloud is bathed
in intense ultraviolet radiation — mainly from the open star cluster Pismis 24,
home to some massive, young, blue stars — which it re-emits as visible light, in
this distinctive red hue. The cluster itself is out of the field of view of this
picture, its diffuse light seen illuminating the cloud on the centre-right of
the image. We are looking at a close-up of the surrounding nebula, showing a
mesh of gas, dark dust, and newly born and still forming stars.

text> ESO’s PESSTO survey has captured this view of Messier 74, a stunning
spiral galaxy with well-defined whirling arms. However, the real subject of this
image is the galaxy’s brilliant new addition from late July 2013: a Type II
supernova named SN2013ej that is visible as the brightest star at the bottom
left of the image. Such supernovae occur when the core of a massive star
collapses due to its own gravity at the end of its life. This collapse results
in a massive explosion that ejects material far into space. The resulting
detonation can be more brilliant than the entire galaxy that hosts it and can be
visible to observers for weeks, or even months. PESSTO (Public ESO Spectroscopic
Survey for Transient Objects) is designed to study objects that appear briefly
in the night sky, such as supernovae. It does this by utilising a number of
instruments on the NTT (New Technology Telescope), located at ESO’s La Silla
Observatory in Chile. This new picture of SN2013ej was obtained using the NTT
during the course of this survey. SN2013ej is the third supernova to have been
observed in Messier 74 since the turn of the millennium, the other two being SN
2002ap and SN 2003gd. It was first reported on 25 July 2013 by the KAIT
telescope team in California, and the first “precovery image” was taken by
amateur astronomer Christina Feliciano, who used the public access SLOOH Space
Camera to look at the region in the days and hours immediately before the
explosion. Messier 74, in the constellation of Pisces (The Fish), is one of the
most difficult Messier objects for amateur astronomers to spot due to its low
surface brightness, but SN2013ej should still be visible to careful amateur
astronomers over the next few weeks as a faint and fading star. Links PESSTO

text> This new image, from ESO’s VISTA telescope, shows a newly-discovered brown
dwarf nicknamed VVV BD001, which is located at the very centre of this zoomable
image. It is the first new brown dwarf spotted in our cosmic neighbourhood as
part of the VVV Survey. VVV BD001 is located about 55 light-years away from us,
towards the very crowded centre of our galaxy. Brown dwarfs are stars that never
quite managed to grow up into a star like our Sun. They are often referred to as
“failed stars”; they are larger in size than planets like Jupiter, but smaller
than stars. This dwarf is peculiar in two ways; firstly, it is the first one
found towards the centre of our Milky Way, one of the most crowded regions of
the sky. Secondly, it belongs to an unusual class of stars known as “unusually
blue brown dwarfs” — it is still unclear why these stars are bluer than
expected. Brown dwarfs are born in the same way as stars, but do not have enough
mass to trigger the burning of hydrogen to become normal stars. Because of this
they are much cooler and produce far less light, making them harder to find.
Astronomers generally look for these objects using near and mid-infrared cameras
and special telescopes that are sensitive to these very cool objects, but
usually avoid looking in very crowded regions of space — such as the central
region of our galaxy, for example. VISTA (the Visible and Infrared Survey
Telescope for Astronomy) is the world’s largest survey telescope and is located
at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile. It is performing six separate surveys of
the sky, and the VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) survey is designed to
catalogue a billion objects in the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy. VVV BD001
was discovered by chance during this survey. Scientists have used the VVV
catalogue to create a 3 dimensional map of the central bulge of the Milky Way
(eso1339). The data have also been used to create a monumental 108 200 by 81 500
pixel colour image containing nearly nine billion pixels (eso1242), one of the
biggest astronomical images ever produced. Links VVV Survey (VISTA Variables in

image taken using the Wide Field Imager (WFI), a camera mounted on the MPG/ESO
2.2-metre telescope located at the La Silla Observatory, Chile. It was snapped
as part of the COMBO-17 survey (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations
in 17 filters), a project that imaged five small patches of sky in 17 different
coloured optical filters. The total area of sky explored in each of the COMBO-17
fields equates to approximately the same size as the full Moon, and has revealed
huge numbers of distant objects — demonstrating just how much is still waiting
to be discovered in our skies. The image shows a region that was also
investigated as part of the FORS Deep Field (FDF), a project that examined
various areas of sky in great detail and depth using the FORS2 spectrograph
instrument currently installed on ESO’s Very Large Telescope at the Paranal
Observatory, Chile. However, these WFI images used many more filters than
previous FDF observations, and looked at bigger patches of sky, resulting in
images like the one above. These small glimpses into the Universe have unveiled
tens of thousands of distant stars, galaxies, and quasars previously hidden from
our view, and have been used to investigate gravitational lensing and the
distribution of dark matter in galaxies and clusters. Links The COMBO-17 survey

text> This new picture from the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at ESO’s Paranal
Observatory shows the remarkable super star cluster Westerlund 1 (eso1034). This
exceptionally bright cluster lies about 16 000 light-years from Earth in the
southern constellation of Ara (The Altar). It contains hundreds of very massive
and brilliant stars, all of which are just a few million years old — babies by
stellar standards. But our view of this cluster is hampered by gas and dust that
prevents most of the visible light from the cluster’s stars from getting to
Earth. Now, astronomers studying images of Westerlund 1 from a new survey of the
southern skies [1] have spotted something unexpected in this cluster. Around one
of the stars — known as W26, a red supergiant and possibly the biggest star
known— they have discovered clouds of glowing hydrogen gas, shown as green
features in this new image. Such glowing clouds around massive stars are very
rare, and are even rarer around a red supergiant— this is the first ionised
nebula discovered around such a star. W26 itself would be too cool to make the
gas glow; the astronomers speculate that the source of the ionising radiation
may be either hot blue stars elsewhere in the cluster, or possibly a fainter,
but much hotter, companion star to W26. W26 will eventually explode as a
supernova. The nebula that surrounds it is very similar to the nebula
surrounding SN1987A, the remnants of a star that went supernova in 1987 [2].
SN1987A was the closest observed supernova to Earth since 1604, and as such it
gave astronomers a chance to explore the properties of these explosions.
Studying objects like this new nebula around W26 will help astronomers to
understand the mass loss processes around these massive stars, which eventually
lead to their explosive demise. Notes [1] This picture forms part of a detailed
public survey of a large part of the Milky Way called VPHAS+ that is using the
power of the VST to search for new objects such as young stars and planetary
nebulae. A spectacular recent picture of the Prawn Nebula was made using
observations from the same survey. [2] This nebula is thought to have surrounded
SN1987A’s progenitor star since before it went supernova. Links Research paper

frame is a deep-field image obtained using the Wide Field Imager (WFI), a camera

covered by the COMBO-17 survey (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations

the southern hemisphere’s sky. Each one of the five patches is recorded using 17
individual colour filters. Each one of the five COMBO-17 images covers an area
of the sky the size of the full Moon. The survey has already revealed thousands
of previously unknown cosmic specimens — over 25 000 galaxies, tens of thousands
of distant stars and quasars previously hidden from our view, showing just how
much we still have to learn about the Universe. Some of the most distant flecks
of light visible in this photo are galaxies whose light has been travelling for
nine or ten billion years before reaching to us. By studying galaxies of
different ages astronomers can understand how they evolve in time, from mature
nearby galaxies similar to our galaxy, the Milky Way, to young ones in the
distant Universe that reveal what the cosmos was like in its infancy. Links :

text> The smokey black silhouette in this new image is part of a large, sparse
cloud of partially ionised hydrogen — an HII region — known as Gum 15. In
wide-field images this nebula appears as a striking reddish purple clump dotted
with stars and slashed by opaque, weaving dust lanes. This image homes in on one
of these dust lanes, showing the central region of the nebula. These dark chunks
of sky have seemingly few stars because lanes of dusty material are obscuring
the bright, glowing regions of gas beyond. The occasional stars that do show up
in these patches are actually between us and Gum 15, but create the illusion
that we are peering through a window out onto the more distant sky. Gum 15 is
shaped by the aggressive winds flowing from the stars within and around it. The
cloud is located near to several large associations of stars including the star
cluster ESO 313-13. The brightest member of this cluster, named HD 74804, is
thought to have ionised Gum 15’s hydrogen cloud. This ionised hydrogen content
is the cause of the red hue permeating the frame. This image was taken as part
of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme [1] using the FORS instrument on the Very Large
Telescope at ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile. This project has actually
produced multiple images of this target — back in July 2014, ESO released a
stunning wide-field image of Gum 15 with the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO
2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory that showed the nebula’s
sculpted clouds, murky dust, and brightly shining stars in extraordinary detail.
The portion of Gum 15 shown in the new and more detailed VLT image can be seen
within the wider frame towards the top left quarter of the 2.2-metre image.
Notes [1] The ESO Cosmic Gems programme is an initiative to produce images of
interesting, intriguing or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for
the purposes of education and public outreach. The programme makes use of
telescope time that cannot be used for science observations. All data collected
may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and are made available to
astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

text> This image shows a region of the Milky Way that lies within the
constellation of Scorpius, close to the central plane of the galaxy. The region
hosts a dense cloud of dust and gas associated with the molecular cloud IRAS
16562-3959, clearly visible as an orange smudge among the rich pool of stars at
the centre of the image. Clouds like these are breeding grounds for new stars.
In the centre of this cloud the bright object known as G345.4938+01.4677 can
just be seen beyond the veil of gas and dust. This is a very young star in the
process of forming as the cloud collapses under gravity. The young star is very
bright and heavy — roughly 15 times more massive than the Sun — and featured in
a recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) result. The team of
astronomers made surprising discoveries within G345.4938+01.4677 — there is a
large disc of gas and dust around the forming star as well as a stream of
material flowing out from it. Theories predict that neither such a stream, nor
the disc itself, are likely to exist around stars like G345.4938+01.4677 because
the strong radiation from such massive new stars is thought to push material
away. This image was made using the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for
Astronomy (VISTA), which is part of ESO’s Paranal Observatory in the Atacama
Desert of Chile. It is the world’s largest survey telescope, with a main mirror
that measures over four metres across. The colour image was produced by the VVV
survey, which is one of six large public surveys that are devoted to mapping the
southern sky. The bright star in the bottom left of the image is known as HD
153220.

text> This image shows the bright centre and swirling arms of the spiral galaxy
NGC 6300. NGC 6300 is located in a starry patch of sky in the southern
constellation of Ara (The Altar) which contains a variety of intriguing deep-sky
objects. NGC 6300 has beautiful pinwheeling arms connected by a straight bar
that cuts through the middle of the galaxy. While it may look like a standard
spiral galaxy in visible-light images like this one, it is actually a Seyfert II
galaxy. Such galaxies have unusually luminous centres that emit very energetic
radiation, meaning that they are often intensely bright in part of the spectrum
either side of the visible. NGC 6300 is thought to contain a massive black hole
at its heart some 300 000 times more massive than the Sun. This black hole is
emitting high energy X-rays as it is fed by the material that is pulled into it.
This image of NGC 6300 was taken by the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera
(EFOSC2) on the 3.58-metre New Technology Telescope (NTT). The NTT is based at
ESO’s La Silla observing site, on the outskirts of the Atacama Desert in Chile,
and was inaugurated in 1989. A black and white image of NGC 6300 was released at
the time of the telescope’s inauguration — one of 31 images that were the first
to be released from the NTT.

text> Rather than showing spectacular objects, some of the most surprising
images of the Universe instead focus on emptiness. This new image from the
2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope shows dark tentacles swirling outwards from a dark,
blank spot of space in the centre of the frame, particularly conspicuous against
the dense peppering of bright gold and red stars across the rest of the image.
This region is not a hole in the cosmos, or an empty patch of sky. The dark
lanes are actually made up of thick, opaque dust lying between us and the packed
star field behind it. This obscuring dust forms part of a dark molecular cloud,
cold and dense areas where large quantities of dust and molecular gas mingle and
block the visible light emitted by more distant stars. It is still unclear how
these clouds form, but they are thought to be the very early stages of new star
formation — in the future, the subject of this image may well collapse inwards
on itself to form a new star system. Although the cloud in this image is a
fairly anonymous resident of the nearby Universe — catalogued as LDN1774 — one
of the most famous examples of a molecular cloud is the very similar Barnard 68,
which lies some 500 light-years away from us. Barnard 68 has been observed
extensively using ESO telescopes, both in visible (eso9924a) and infrared light
(eso9934, eso0102a). As shown in these different images, it is possible to probe
through dark cosmic dust using infrared light, but visible-light observations
such as those shown in this VLT image cannot see beyond the smokescreen. This
image was taken by the Wide Field Imager, an instrument mounted on ESO’s
2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla, Chile.

text> The Crab Nebula, which also goes by the names Messier 1, NGC 1952 and
Taurus A, is one of the best studied astronomical objects in the sky. It is the
remnant of a supernova explosion which was observed by Chinese astronomers in
1054. The tangled filaments visible in this image are the remains of the
exploded star, which are still expanding outwards at about 1500 kilometres per
second. Although not visible to the naked eye due to foreground filaments of
helium and hydrogen the heart of the nebula hosts two faint stars. It is one of
these that is responsible for the nebula that we see today — a star that is
known as the Crab Pulsar, or CM Tau. This is the small, dense, corpse of the
original star that caused the supernova. It is now only about 20 kilometres in
diameter and rotates around its axis 30 times every second! The star emits
pulses of radiation in all wavelengths, ranging from gamma rays — for which it
is one of the brightest sources in the sky — to radio waves. The radiation from
the star is so strong that it is creating a wave of material that is deforming
the inner parts of the nebula. The appearance of these structures changes so
fast that astronomers can actually observe how they reshape. This provides a
rare opportunity as cosmic timescales are usually much too long for change to be
observed to this extent. The data from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO
2.2-metre telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile used to make this
image were selected from the ESO archive by Manu Mejias as part of the Hidden
Treasures competition.

text> The bright star in the centre of this image is not the star of this show.
At the bottom centre is a rather unremarkable smudge of red which is in fact a
rare and valuable object. First discovered by amateur Japanese astronomer, Yukio
Sakurai, in 1996, and noted as a nova-like object, Sakurai’s discovery turned
out to be far more interesting than the supernova he initially supposed it to
be. The object is actually a small white dwarf star undergoing a helium flash —
one of only a handful of examples of such an event ever witnessed by
astronomers. Normally, the white dwarf stage is the last in the life cycle of a
low-mass star. In some cases, however, the star reignites in a helium flash and
expands to return to a red giant state, ejecting huge amounts of gas and dust in
the process, before once again shrinking to become a white dwarf. It is a
dramatic and short-lived series of events, and Sakurai’s Object has allowed
astronomers a very rare opportunity to study the events in real time. The white
dwarf emits sufficient ultraviolet radiation to illuminate the gas it has
expelled, which can just be seen in this image as the ring of red material. This
image was taken using the FORS instrument, mounted on ESO’s Very Large
Telescope.

text> A pair of jets protrude outwards in near-perfect symmetry in this image of
Herbig-Haro object (HH) 212, taken by ESO’s already decommissioned Infrared
Spectrometer And Array Camera (ISAAC). The object lies in the constellation of
Orion (The Hunter) in a dense molecular star-forming region, not far from the
famous Horsehead Nebula. In regions like this, clouds of dust and gas collapse
under the force of gravity, spinning faster and faster and becoming hotter and
hotter until a young star ignites at the cloud’s centre. Any leftover material
swirling around the newborn protostar comes together to form an accretion disc
that will, under the right circumstances, eventually evolve to form the base
material for the creation of planets, asteroids and comets. Although this
process is still not fully understood, it is common that a protostar and its
accretion disc, as seen here edge-on, are the cause of the jets in this image.
The star at the centre of HH 212 is indeed a very young star, at only a few
thousand years old. Its jets are remarkably symmetric, with several knots
appearing at relatively stable intervals. This stability suggests that the jet
pulses vary quite regularly, and over a short timescale — maybe even as short as
30 years! Further out from the centre, large bow shocks spread out into
interstellar space, caused by ejected gas colliding with dust and gas at speeds
of several hundred kilometres per second.

text> Observations by ESO’s planet-finding instrument, SPHERE, a high-contrast
adaptive optics system installed on the third Unit Telescope of ESO’s Very Large
Telescope, have revealed the edge-on disc of gas and dust present around the
binary star system HD 106906AB. HD 106906AB is a double star located in the
constellation of Crux (The Southern Cross). Astronomers had long suspected that
this 13 million-year-old stellar duo was encircled by a debris disc, due to the
system’s youth and characteristic radiation. However, this disc had remained
unseen — until now! The system’s spectacular debris disc can be seen towards the
lower left area of this image. It is surrounding both stars, hence its name of
circumbinary disc. The stars themselves are hidden behind a mask which prevent
their glare from blinding the instrument. These stars and the disc are also
accompanied by an exoplanet, visible in the upper right, named HD 106906 b,
which orbits around the binary star and its disc at a distance greater than any
other exoplanet discovered to date — 650 times the average Earth–Sun distance,
or nearly 97 billion kilometres. HD 106906 b has a mammoth mass of up to 11
times that of Jupiter, and a scorching surface temperature of 1500 degrees
Celsius. Thanks to SPHERE, HD 106906AB has become the first binary star system
to have both an exoplanet and a debris disc successfully imaged, providing
astronomers with a unique opportunity to study the complex process of
circumbinary planet formation.

text> This fetching cloud of gas was imaged by the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph
and Camera (EFOSC2) at ESO’s La Silla Observatory. It can be found nestled in
the busy constellation of Centaurus in the skies of the southern hemisphere. The
cloud of gas — named NGC 3699 — is a planetary nebula, It is distinguished by an
irregular mottled appearance and a dark rift, which roughly bisects it. These
objects, despite the name, have nothing to do with planets and are created in
the final stages of the evolution of stars similar in mass to the Sun. The name
“planetary nebula” arises from the time of their discovery by William Herschel,
when they appeared in the telescopes of the time as rounded objects similar in
looks to the planets. Towards the end of their lives, stars like the Sun exhaust
the supply of hydrogen in their cores, putting a stop to nuclear reactions. This
causes the star’s core to contract under the force of gravity and heat up, while
the cooler outer layers expand tremendously — the surface of the Sun, for
example, will likely engulf the orbit of Earth when it reaches this stage in its
evolution. Unusually strong stellar winds push the gaseous outer layers of the
star out into space, eventually exposing the core of the star, which begins to
emit ultraviolet radiation, ionising the expelled gas, causing the nebula’s
ethereal glow, and producing beautiful and varied sights, such as the one in
this image.

text> This picture of the week shows the spiral galaxy NGC 986 in the
constellation of Fornax (The Furnace). The galaxy, which was discovered in 1826
by the Scottish astronomer James Dunlop, is not often imaged due to its
proximity to the famous and rich Fornax Cluster of galaxies. Which is a shame,
as this galaxy is not only a great scientific object, but also very pretty. The
galaxy is about 56 million light-years away and seen almost perfectly from the
top, or — as astronomers say — face-on. This allows us to see the two main
spiral arms and also a central bar-shaped structure, composed of stars and dust,
which makes it a barred spiral galaxy. Astronomical surveys have shown that
about two thirds of all spiral galaxies contain a bar, including the Milky Way.
This makes NGC 986 the perfect place to study the structure of galaxies and find
out more about our own home galaxy, which is difficult to study from within.
This view from the FORS instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope at the Paranal
Observatory in northern Chile comes from the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an
outreach initiative to produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually
attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and
public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used
for science observations. All data collected may also be suitable for scientific
purposes, and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

text> The dark patch snaking across this spectacular image of a field of stars
in the constellation of Ophiuchus (The Serpent-bearer) is not quite what it
appears to be. Although it looks as if there are no stars here, they are hidden
behind this dense cloud of dust that blocks out their light. This particular
dark cloud is known as LDN 1768. Despite their rather dull appearance, dark
nebulae like LDN 1768 are of huge interest to astronomers, as it is here that
new stars form. Inside these vast stellar nurseries there are protostars — stars
at the earliest stage of their lives, still coalescing out of the gas and dust
in the cloud. Protostars are relatively cold and have not yet begun to produce
enough energy to emit visible light. Instead, they emit radiation at
submillimetre wavelengths, which human eyes cannot see. Luckily, unlike visible
light, light at submillimetre wavelengths is not absorbed by the surrounding
dust. By using special telescopes that are sensitive to submillimetre radiation,
like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observatory, we can
see through the dust and find out more about the protostars within the cloud.
Eventually, the protostars will become dense and hot enough to start the nuclear
reactions that will produce visible light and they will start to shine. When
this happens, they will blow away the cocoon of dust surrounding them and cause
any remaining gas to emit light as well, creating the spectacular light show
known as an HII region.

text> This Picture of the Week shows the Vela ring galaxy, visible as a bright
core surrounded by a baby blue halo. This ring galaxy — located in the southern
constellation of Antlia (The Pump) — is notable due to its compact core and
large circular belt of gas and stars. It is thought that ring galaxies like this
are created when larger galaxies are punctured by a smaller galactic aggressor,
which, passing through the heart of its more sizeable victim, triggers a shock
wave that spreads outwards. This pushes gas to the galaxy’s periphery, where it
begins to collapse and form new stars. The Vela ring galaxy is unusual in that
it actually exhibits at least two rings, suggesting that the collision was not a
recent one. This picture also features a galaxy known as ESO 316-33, seen just
above and to the left of the Vela ring galaxy, and a bright star known as HD
88170.

text> Using 39 of the 66 antennas of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), located 5000 metres up on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean
Andes, astronomers have been able to detect carbon monoxide (CO) in the disc of
debris around an F-type star. Although carbon monoxide is the second most common
molecule in the interstellar medium, after molecular hydrogen, this is the first
time that CO has been detected around a star of this type. The star, named HD
181327, is a member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, located almost 170
light-years from Earth. Until now, the presence of CO has been detected only
around a few A-type stars, substantially more massive and luminous than HD
181327. Using the superb spatial resolution and sensitivity offered by the ALMA
observatory astronomers were now able to capture this stunning ring of smoke and
map the density of the CO within the disc. The study of debris discs is one way
to characterise planetary systems and the results of planet formation. The CO
gas is found to be co-located with the dust grains in the ring of debris and to
have been produced recently. Destructive collisions of icy planetesimals in the
disc are possible sources for the continuous replenishment of the CO gas.
Collisions in debris discs typically require the icy bodies to be
gravitationally perturbed by larger objects in order to reach sufficient
collisional velocities. Moreover, the derived CO composition of the icy
planetesimals in the disc is consistent with the comets in our Solar System.
This possible secondary origin for the CO gas suggests that icy comets could be
common around stars similar to our Sun which has strong implications for life
suitability in terrestrial exoplanets. The results were published in the journal
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society under the title “Exocometary
gas in the HD 181327 debris ring” by S. Marino et al. Link: Paper by Marino et

text> Astronomers hunt for planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets) using a
variety of methods. One successful method is direct imaging; this is
particularly effective for planets on wide orbits around young stars, because
the light from the planet is not overwhelmed by light from the host star and is
thus easier to spot. This image demonstrates this technique. It shows a T-Tauri
star named CVSO 30, located approximately 1200 light-years away from Earth in
the 25 Orionis group (slightly northwest of Orion’s famous Belt). In 2012,
astronomers found that CVSO 30 hosted one exoplanet (CVSO 30b) using a detection
method known as transit photometry, where the light from a star observably dips
as a planet travels in front of it. Now, astronomers have gone back to look at
the system using a number of telescopes. The study combines observations
obtained with the ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, the W. M. Keck
Observatory in Hawaii, and the Calar Alto Observatory facilities in Spain. Using
the data astronomers have imaged what is likely to be a second planet! To
produce the image, astronomers exploited the astrometry provided by VLT’s NACO
and SINFONI instruments. This new exoplanet, named CVSO 30c, is the small dot to
the upper left of the frame (the large blob is the star itself). While the
previously-detected planet, CVSO 30b, orbits very close to the star, whirling
around CVSO 30 in just under 11 hours at an orbital distance of 0.008 au, CVSO
30c orbits significantly further out, at a distance of 660 au, taking a
staggering 27 000 years to complete a single orbit. (For reference, the planet
Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of 0.39 au, while Neptune sits at
just over 30 au.) If it is confirmed that CVSO 30c orbits CVSO 30, this would be
the first star system to host both a close-in exoplanet detected by the transit
method and a far-out exoplanet detected by direct imaging. Astronomers are still
exploring how such an exotic system came to form in such a short timeframe, as
the star is only 2.5 million years old; it is possible that the two planets
interacted at some point in the past, scattering off one another and settling in
their current extreme orbits. Link: Research paper by Schmidt et al.

text> The colour blue has many associations — coldness, sadness, serenity.
However, the colour holds a completely different meaning for astronomers, as
demonstrated by the edge-on spiral galaxy Messier 98. Messier 98, also known as
NGC 4192, is located approximately 50 million light-years away in the
constellation of Coma Berenices (Berenice’s Hair). In this spectacular image
from ESO’s New Technology Telescope (NTT), the galaxy’s perimeter, rippled with
gas and dust, is dotted with pockets of blueish light. These are regions filled
with very young stars, which are so hot that they glow with a bright blue hue.
These young stars are burning at such high temperatures that they are emitting
fierce radiation, burning away some of the dense material that surrounds them.
In total, Messier 98 is thought to contain one trillion stars! The NTT is a
3.58-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory, which pioneered the use of
active optics and was the first in the world to have a computer-controlled main
mirror.

text> This beautiful image, captured with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) features a protoplanetary disc surrounding
the young star Elias 2-27, some 450 light years away. ALMA has discovered and
observed plenty of protoplanetary discs, but this disc is special as it shows
two distinct spiral arms, almost like a tiny version of a spiral galaxy.
Previously, astronomers noted compelling spiral features on the surfaces of
protoplanetary discs, but it was unknown if these same spiral patterns also
emerged deep within the disc where planet formation takes place. ALMA, for the
first time, was able to peer deep into the mid-plane of a disk and discovered
the clear signature of spiral density waves. Nearest to the star, ALMA found a
flat disc of dust, which extends to what would approximately be the orbit of
Neptune in our own Solar System. Beyond that point, in the region analogous to
our Kuiper Belt, ALMA detected a narrow band with significantly less dust, which
may be an indication for planet in formation. Springing from the outer edge of
this gap are the two sweeping spiral arms that extend more than 10 billion
kilometers away from their host star. The discovery of spiral waves at these
extreme distances may have implications on the theory of planet formation.

text> For the first time, astronomers have seen a dusty disc of material around
a young star fragmenting into a multiple star system. This image comprises new
observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA),
Chile, and reveals the process in action! Stars form in cosmic clouds of gas and
dust, when the thin material in the clouds collapses gravitationally into denser
cores that in turn draw additional material inward. The infalling material forms
a rotating disc around the young star, and is slowly consumed. Eventually, the
young star gathers enough mass to create the necessary temperatures and
pressures at its centre to trigger nuclear fusion. Stars that have no companion
— such as the Sun — are not as common as we once thought. In fact, almost half
of the stars in our galaxy have at least one companion, and some are more
sociable still! Previous studies have indicated that the stars in multiple
systems tend to be either relatively close to each other, within about 500 times
the Earth-Sun distance (known as an Astronomical Unit or AU), or significantly
further apart, at over 1000 AU. Given these wildly different distances,
scientists concluded that there were two main mechanisms producing multiple star
systems — either the original cloud collapsed unstably and fragmented, each
subsequent fragment crumpling to form a new star, or the rotating disc around an
existing star fragmented, with the same result. Systems with larger separations
likely formed via the former process (as recent observational studies have
suggested), and closer-knit stellar families via the latter (although there was
limited evidence of this process). New data from ALMA have now offered
observational evidence of this conclusion. This image shows the second process
in action, as seen in the young triple star system L1448 IRS3B. The trio are
still deeply embedded within their parent cloud in the constellation of Perseus,
some 750 light-years from Earth, and are hungrily feeding from material in the
surrounding disc. ALMA has revealed this disc to have a spiral structure, a
feature that indicates gravitational instability. Notes: The Atacama Large

text> Astronomers spend their time gazing out into the Universe — and
occasionally the Universe seems to peer right back! This image, a composite of
data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, shows a very rare cosmic sight: a pair of
interacting galaxies that have taken on an ocular structure. As the name
suggests, some types of grazing encounters between galaxies create shapes that
resemble the human eye. While galaxy collisions of this type are not uncommon,
only a few galaxies with eye-like, or ocular, structures have been observed. The
paucity of these features is likely due to their very ephemeral nature — ocular
structures like these tend to only last for several tens of millions of years,
which is merely the blink of an eye in a galactic lifetime. These two galaxies
are named IC 2163 (left) and NGC 2207 (right) — IC 2163 displays the ocular
structure in this image. The duo lies approximately 114 million light-years from
Earth in the direction of the constellation of Canis Major (The Greater Dog).
The galaxies have brushed past each other — scraping the outer edges of their
spiral arms —with IC 2163 passing behind NGC 2207. This glancing collision
triggered a tsunami of stars and gas in IC 2163, with material in the outer
portions of the disc of the galaxy travelling inwards This colossal wave of
material decelerated rapidly moving from the outer to the inner edge of the
eyelids and crashed midway through the galaxy’s disc, producing dazzling ribbons
of intense star formation and compressed ridges of gas and dust that resemble a
pair of cosmic “eyelids”. Notes The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array

text> Our Solar System formed out of a huge, primordial cloud of gas and dust.
The vast majority of that cloud formed the Sun, while the leftover disc of
rotating material around it eventually coalesced into the orbiting planets we
know — and live on — today. Astronomers can observe similar processes happening
around other stars in the cosmos. This splendid Picture of the Week shows a disc
of rotating, leftover material surrounding the young star HD 163296. Using the
observing power of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in
Chile, astronomers have been able to discern specific features in the disc,
including concentric rings of material surrounding the central star. They were
even able to use ALMA to obtain high-resolution measurements of the gas and dust
constituents of the disc. With these data they could infer key details of the
formation history of this young stellar system. The three gaps between the rings
are likely due to a depletion of dust and in the middle and outer gaps
astronomers also found a lower level of gas. The depletion of both dust and gas
suggests the presence of newly formed planets, each around the mass of Saturn,
carving out these gaps on their brand new orbits.

text> Over 75 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo (The
Virgin) lies NGC 4981 — a spiral galaxy with a rather explosive past. NGC 4981
was discovered on 17 April 1784 by William Herschel, and subsequently documented
in John Dreyer’s New General Catalogue. Over a century later, on 23 April 1968,
the galaxy once again made it into the records when a Type la supernova — a
stellar explosion in a binary star system — occurred within its confines: SN
1968I. SN 1968I, however, was not to be the galaxy’s only supernova. Decades
later, the core collapse of a massive star led to supernova SN 2007c. This
spectacular shot of NGC 4981 — not showing any of the supernovae explosions; the
bright star visible in the image is a foreground star — was captured by FORS,
the visible and near-UV FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph for ESO’s
Very Large Telescope (VLT). FORS is the Swiss Army knife of ESO’s instruments —
it is able to study many different astronomical objects in many different ways,
and is responsible for some of the most iconic photos ever captured with the VLT
(see eso9948f and eso0202a). The data to create this image was selected from the
ESO archive by Josh Barrington as part of the Hidden Treasures competition.

text> The events surrounding the Big Bang were so cataclysmic that they left an
indelible imprint on the fabric of the cosmos. We can detect these scars today
by observing the oldest light in the Universe. As it was created nearly 14
billion years ago, this light — which exists now as weak microwave radiation and
is thus named the cosmic microwave background (CMB) — has now expanded to
permeate the entire cosmos, filling it with detectable photons. The CMB can be
used to probe the cosmos via something known as the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ)
effect, which was first observed over 30 years ago. We detect the CMB here on
Earth when its constituent microwave photons travel to us through space. On
their journey to us, they can pass through galaxy clusters that contain
high-energy electrons. These electrons give the photons a tiny boost of energy.
Detecting these boosted photons through our telescopes is challenging but
important — they can help astronomers to understand some of the fundamental
properties of the Universe, such as the location and distribution of dense
galaxy clusters. This image shows the first measurements of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) in Chile (in blue). Astronomers combined data from ALMA’s 7- and 12-metre
antennas to produce the sharpest possible image. The target was one of the most
massive known galaxy clusters, RX J1347.5–1145, the centre of which shows up
here in the dark “hole” in the ALMA observations. The energy distribution of the
CMB photons shifts and appears as a temperature decrease at the wavelength
observed by ALMA, hence a dark patch is observed in this image at the location
of the cluster. Links ESA/Hubble Picture of the Week

text> Three decades ago, astronomers spotted one of the brightest supernovae in
more than 400 years. The stellar explosion, SN 1987A, blazed with the power of
100 million suns for several months after its discovery on 23 February 1987.
Located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the Milky Way’s satellite
galaxies, SN 1987A was the nearest supernova explosion observed in centuries and
it quickly became the best studied supernova of all time. Over the last thirty
years, detailed follow-up observations with telescopes both in space and on the
ground have allowed astronomers to study the death throes of a massive star in
unprecedented detail, from star to supernova to supernova remnant,
revolutionising our understanding of these explosive events. With its superb
sensitivity at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has been exploring previously unstudied
aspects of SN 1987A since 2013. Astronomers are using ALMA to observe the
glowing remains of the supernova in high resolution, studying how the remnant is
making vast amounts of dust from the new elements created in the progenitor
star. A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may
one day be the material from which future planets around other stars are made.
These observations suggest that dust in the early Universe was created by
similar supernova explosions. The composite image presented here combines
observations made with ALMA, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and NASA’s
Chandra X-Ray observatory. Links ALMA press release Hubble pres release

text> Although it looks like the pattern of a shell on the beach, this
intriguing spiral is in fact astronomical in nature. The Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) captured this remarkable image of a binary
star system, where two stars — LL Pegasi and its companion — are locked in a
stellar waltz, orbiting around their common centre of gravity. The old star LL
Pegasi is continuously losing gaseous material as it evolves into a planetary
nebula, and the distinct spiral shape is the imprint made by the stars orbiting
in this gas. The spiral spans light-years and winds around with extraordinary
regularity. Based on the expansion rate of the spiralling gas, astronomers
estimate that a new “layer” appears every 800 years — approximately the same
time it takes for the two stars to complete one orbit around each other. LL
Pegasi was first highlighted about 10 years ago when the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
Telescope obtained a picture of the almost-perfect spiral structure. This was
the first time a spiral pattern had been found in material surrounding an old
star. Now, ALMA’s observations, of which this image only shows one
“cross-section”, have added an extra dimension to reveal the exquisitely-ordered
3D geometry of the spiral pattern. A full view of the 3D video can be seen in
this video. An additional image shows a composition of the ALMA and Hubble data.

text> This image, taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) in Chile, shows glowing dust inside the protocluster NGC 6334I. Studying
this star-forming cloud in the Cat’s Paw Nebula (NGC 6334) with both ALMA and
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii astronomers could see that something
dramatic had taken place, completely changing a stellar nursery over a
surprisingly short period of time. It is known that young stars form inside
protoclusters when pockets of gas become so dense that they begin to collapse
under their own gravity. Over time, discs of dust and gas form around these
nascent stars and funnel material onto their surfaces helping them grow.
However, this new image from ALMA shows a massive protostar, nestled deep within
this dust-filled stellar nursery, that is undergoing an intense growth spurt,
most likely triggered by an avalanche of gas falling onto its surface. This new
material feeding it is causing the protostar to shine nearly 100 times brighter
than before.The discovery of this outburst supports the theory that young stars
can undergo intense growth spurts that reshape their surroundings.

text> This image depicts the dusty disc encircling the young, isolated star HD
169142. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaged this disc
in high resolution by picking up faint signals from its constituent
millimetre-sized dust grains. The vivid rings are thick bands of dust, separated
by deep gaps. Optimised to study the cold gas and dust of systems like HD
169142, ALMA’s sharp eyes have revealed the structure of many infant solar
systems with similar cavities and gaps. A variety of theories have been proposed
to explain them — such as turbulence caused by magnetorotational instability, or
the fusing of dust grains — but the most plausible explanation is that these
pronounced gaps were carved out by giant protoplanets. When solar systems form
gas and dust coalesce into planets. These planets then effectively spring clean
their orbits, clearing them of gas and dust and herding the remaining material
into well-defined bands. The deep gaps seen in this image are consistent with
the presence of multiple protoplanets — a finding that agrees with other optical
and infrared studies of the same system. Observing such dusty protoplanetary
discs with ALMA allows scientists to investigate the first steps of planet
formation in a bid to unveil the evolutionary paths of these infant systems.

text> This intriguing image may look like a collection of coloured blobs, but it
is actually a high-resolution snapshot of a newborn star enshrouded in dust.
Just 1300 light-years away in the Orion Nebula, the star, named HH 212, is
remarkably young. The average lifespan of such a low-mass star is around 100
billion years, but this star is only 40 000 years old — truly an infant in
stellar terms. In the cores of the vast molecular clouds in star formation
regions, an ongoing battle rages; gravity versus the pressure of gas and dust.
If gravity wins, it forces the gas and dust to collapse into a hot dense core
that eventually ignites — forming a protostar. All the leftover gas and dust
form a spinning disc around this baby star, and in many star systems they
eventually coalesce to make planets. Such very young protostellar discs have
been hard to image because of their relatively small size, but now the
exceedingly high resolution of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) makes it possible to understand the intricate details of star and planet
formation. A closer look at HH 212 reveals a prominent, cool, dark dust lane
running through the disc, sandwiched between two brighter regions that are
heated by the protostar. The result resembles a cosmic “hamburger”. This is the
very first time astronomers have spotted such a dust lane in the earliest phases
of star formation, and so it may provide clues as to how planetary systems are
born.

text> Fomalhaut is one of the brightest stars in the sky. At roughly 25
light-years away the star lies especially close to us, and can be seen shining
brightly in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus (The Southern Fish). This
image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) shows
Fomalhaut (centre) encircled by a ring of dusty debris — this is the first time
this scene has been captured at such high resolution and sensitivity at
millimetre wavelengths. Fomalhaut’s disc comprises a mix of cosmic dust and gas
from comets in the Fomalhaut system (exocomets), released as the exocomets graze
past and smash into one another. This turbulent environment resembles an early
period in our own Solar System known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, which
occurred approximately four billions years ago. This era saw huge numbers of
rocky objects hurtle into the inner Solar System and collide with the young
terrestrial planets, including Earth, where they formed a myriad of impact
craters — many of which remain visible today on the surfaces of planets such as
Mercury and Mars. Fomalhaut is known to be surrounded by several discs of debris
— the one visible in this ALMA image is the outermost one. The ring is
approximately 20 billion kilometers from the central star and about 2 billion
kilometers wide. Such a relative narrow, eccentric disc can only be produced by
the gravitational influence of planets in the system, like Jupiter’s
gravitational influence on our asteroid belt. In 2008 the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
Telescope discovered the famous exoplanet Fomalhaut b orbiting within this belt,
but the planet is not visible in this ALMA image. Link: NRAO press release

elongated shape, in orange. Since 2003 the nebula, located about 5000
light-years from Earth, has held the record for the coldest known object in the
Universe. The nebula is thought to have formed from the envelope of a star in
its later stages of life which engulfed a smaller, binary companion. It is
possible that this is the cause of the ultra-cold outflows, which are
illuminated by the light of the central, dying star. ALMA looked at the nebula’s
central dusty disc and the outflows further out, which span a distance of almost
four light-years across the sky. These outflows are even colder than the cosmic
microwave background, reaching temperatures below –270 °C. The outflows are also
expanding at a speed of 590 000 kilometres per hour. Link NRAO press release

text> This orange blob shows the nearby star Betelgeuse, as seen by the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This is the first time that ALMA
has ever observed the surface of a star and this first attempt has resulted in
the highest-resolution image of Betelgeuse available. Betelgeuse is one of the
largest stars currently known — with a radius around 1400 times larger than the
Sun’s in the millimeter continuum. About 600 light-years away in the
constellation of Orion (The Hunter), the red supergiant burns brightly, causing
it to have only a short life expectancy. The star is just about eight million
years old, but is already on the verge of becoming a supernova. When that
happens, the resulting explosion will be visible from Earth, even in broad
daylight. The star has been observed in many other wavelengths, particularly in
the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet. Using ESO’s Very Large Telescope
astronomers discovered a vast plume of gas almost as large as our Solar System.
Astronomers have also found a gigantic bubble that boils away on Betelgeuse’s
surface. These features help to explain how the star is shedding gas and dust at
tremendous rates (eso0927, eso1121). In this picture, ALMA observes the hot gas
of the lower chromosphere of Betelgeuse at sub-millimeter wavelengths — where
localised increased temperatures explain why it is not symmetric.
Scientifically, ALMA can help us to understand the extended atmospheres of these
hot, blazing stars. Links: Size comparison: Betelgeuse and the Sun Scientific

text> Approximately 95 million light-years away, in the southern constellation
of Octans (The Octant), lies NGC 7098 — an intriguing spiral galaxy with
numerous sets of double features. The first of NGC 7098’s double features is a
duo of distinct ring-like structures that loop around the galaxy’s hazy heart.
These are NGC 7098’s spiral arms, which have wound themselves around the
galaxy’s luminous core. This central region hosts a second double feature: a
double bar. NGC 7098 has also developed features known as ansae, visible as
small, bright streaks at each end of the central region. Ansae are visible areas
of overdensity — they commonly take looping, linear, or circular shapes, and can
be found at the extremities of planetary ring systems, in nebulous clouds, and,
as is the case with NGC 7098, in parts of galaxies that are packed to the brim
with stars. This image is formed from data gathered by the FOcal Reducer and low
dispersion Spectrograph (FORS) instrument, installed on ESO’s Very Large
Telescope at Paranal Observatory. An array of distant galaxies are also visible
throughout the frame, the most prominent being the small, edge-on, spiral galaxy
visible to the left of NGC 7098, known as PGC 246235.

text> This image from the Wide-Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope
shows the starry skies around a galaxy cluster named PLCKESZ G286.6-31.3. The
cluster itself is difficult to spot initially, but shows up as a subtle
clustering of yellowish galaxies near the centre of the frame. PLCKESZ
G286.6-31.3 houses up to 1000 galaxies, in addition to large quantities of hot
gas and dark matter. As such, the cluster has a total mass of 530 trillion (530
000 000 000 000) times the mass of the Sun. When viewed from Earth, PLCKESZ
G286.6-31.3 is seen through the outer fringes of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) — one of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxies. The LMC hosts over 700 star
clusters, in addition to hundreds of thousands of giant and supergiant stars.
The majority of the cosmic objects captured in this image are stars and star
clusters located inside the LMC. The globular star cluster lower left is IC
2140. The MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope has been in operation at ESO’s La Silla
Observatory since 1984. The telescope has been utilised for a variety of
cutting-edge scientific studies, including ground-breaking research into
gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the Universe. The
67-million-pixel Wide Field Imager (WFI) — mounted on the telescope’s Cassegrain
focus — has been obtaining detailed views of faint, distant objects since 1999.
The data to create this image was selected from the ESO archive as part of the

text> This spectacular spiral galaxy, known as NGC 1964, resides approximately
70 million light-years away in the constellation of Lepus (The Hare). NGC 1964
has a bright and dense core. This core sits within a mottled oval disc, which is
itself encircled by distinct spiral arms speckled with bright starry regions.
The brilliant centre of the galaxy caught the eye of the astronomer William
Herschel on the night of 20 November 1784, leading to the galaxy’s discovery and
subsequent documentation in the New General Catalogue. In addition to containing
stars, NGC 1964 lives in a star-sprinkled section of the sky. In this view from
the Wide Field Imager (WFI) — an instrument mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre
telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory, Chile — the star HD 36785 can be seen
to the galaxy’s immediate right. Above it reside two other prominent stars named
HD 36784 and TYC 5928-368-1 — and the large bright star below NGC 1964 is known
as BD-22 1147. This view of NGC 1964 also contains an array of galaxies, visible
in the background. The WFI is able to observe the light from these distant
galaxies, and those up to 40 million times fainter than the human eye can see.

text> This image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
shows V1247 Orionis, a young, hot star surrounded by a dynamic ring of gas and
dust, known as a circumstellar disc. This disc can be seen here in two parts: a
clearly defined central ring of matter and a more delicate crescent structure
located further out. The region between the ring and crescent, visible as a dark
strip, is thought to be caused by a young planet carving its way through the
disc. As the planet orbits around its parent star, its motion creates areas of
high pressure on either side of its path, similar to how a ship creates bow
waves as it cuts through water. These areas of high pressure could become
protective barriers around sites of planet formation; dust particles are trapped
within them for millions of years, allowing them the time and space to clump
together and grow. The exquisite resolution of ALMA allows astronomers to study
the intricate structure of such a dust trapping vortex for the first time. The
image reveals not only the crescent-shaped dust trap at the outer edge of the
dark strip, but also regions of excess dust within the ring, possibly indicating
a second dust trap that formed inside of the potential planet’s orbit. This
confirms the predictions of earlier computer simulations. Dust trapping is one
potential solution to a major stumbling block in current theories of how planets
form, which predicts that particles should drift into the central star and be
destroyed before they have time to grow to planetesimal sizes (the radial drift
problem). Links Science paper

text> This Picture of the Week shows a huge cloud of gas around the distant
quasar SDSS J102009.99+104002.7, taken by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer
(MUSE) instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal
Observatory. Quasars are the luminous centres of active galaxies, which are kept
active by material falling onto the central supermassive black hole. This quasar
and its surrounding cloud are at a redshift larger than 3, meaning that they are
seen as they were only about 2 billion years after the Big Bang. The cloud of
gas (or nebula) surrounding the quasar is known to astronomers as an Enormous
Lyman-Alpha Nebula (ELAN). These types of nebula are massive structures of gas
which formed in the early Universe, and they can help astronomers to learn how
angular momentum — which explains the observed rotation of more recent galaxies
— was created in the Universe. Thanks to the revolutionary MUSE instrument, it
is now possible to observe these rare giant nebulae in greater detail than ever
before. This particular ELAN has a diameter of about a million light-years, and
MUSE’s spectral imaging capabilities have allowed astronomers to measure the
signature of inspiraling motions within the nebula — for the first time ever.

text> This image shows something spectacular: a massive galaxy cluster that it
is warping the space around it! The cluster, whose heart is at the centre of the
frame, is named RCS2 J2327, and is one of the most massive clusters known at its
distance or beyond. Massive objects such as RCS2 J2327 have such a strong
influence on their surroundings that they visibly warp the space around them.
This effect is known as gravitational lensing. In this way, they cause the light
from more distant objects to be bent, distorted, and magnified, allowing us to
see galaxies that would otherwise be far too distant to detect. Gravitational
lensing is one of the predictions of Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
Strong lensing produces stunning images of distorted galaxies and sweeping arcs;
both of which can be seen in this image. Weak gravitational lensing, on the
other hand, is more subtle, hardly seen directly in an image, and is mostly
studied statistically — but it provides a way to measure the masses of cosmic
objects, as in the case of this cluster. This image is a composite of
observations from the HAWK-I instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys. It demonstrates
an impressively detailed collaborative approach to studying weak lensing in the
cosmos. The study found RCS2 J2327 to contain the mass of two quadrillion Suns!
The diffuse blue and white image covering the picture shows a mass map. It is
connected to the amount of mass thought to be contained within each region.

text> This week’s picture shows spectacular ribbons of gas and dust wrapping
around the pearly centre of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1398. This galaxy is
located in the constellation of Fornax (The Furnace), approximately 65 million
light-years away. Rather than beginning at the very middle of the galaxy and
swirling outwards, NGC 1398’s graceful spiral arms stem from a straight bar,
formed of stars, that cuts through the galaxy’s central region. Most spiral
galaxies — around two thirds — are observed to have this feature, but it’s not
yet clear whether or how these bars affect a galaxy’s behaviour and development.
This image comprises data gathered by the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion
Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) instrument, mounted on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT)
at Paranal Observatory, Chile. It shows NGC 1398 in striking detail, from the
dark lanes of dust mottling its spiral arms, through to the pink-hued
star-forming regions sprinkled throughout its outer regions. This image was
created as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an outreach initiative to
produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually attractive objects using
ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and public outreach. The programme
makes use of telescope time that cannot be used for science observations. All
data collected may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and are made
available to astronomers through ESO’s science archive.

text> Squint or you’ll miss it! At the very centre of this image, taken with the
VIMOS instrument attached to ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), you can just
about see the faint and fuzzy blue form of a distant galaxy known as the
Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy. Discovered in 1977 with the ESO 1-metre
Schmidt telescope, situated at ESO’s La Silla observatory, the irregularly
shaped — hence the name — dwarf galaxy is approximately 3 million light-years
away in the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer). It is the most distant
member of the Local Group of galaxies, of which the Milky Way is a member.
Unlike normal galaxies, dwarf galaxies are typically smaller and host a
relatively small number of stars. Gravitational tugs from nearby galaxies can
often distort the spherical and disc-like shapes of these fragile galaxies —
this very process may be responsible for the slightly rectangular shape of this
particular dwarf galaxy.Acknowledgement: M. Bellazzini et al.

text> This unusual image reveals the aftermath of a catastrophic collision
between two galaxies, which happened about one billion years ago. The result? A
single, very oddly shaped galaxy named NGC 7252, and curiously nicknamed the
Atoms for Peace galaxy. At the heart of this merger remnant lies a fascinating
“minispiral” — a rotating disc of glowing gas, bursting with star formation.
Using the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) instrument on ESO’s Very
Large Telescope, astronomers were able to measure the movement of the gas within
this disc, allowing them to map its rotation. Red regions indicate gas moving
away from us, and blue regions towards us. Together, these colours reveal the
galaxy’s steadily rotating centre, as well as highlighting two flowing streams
of hot gas north-west and south-east of the central region. Past studies
suggested that the central spiral was rotating counter to the rest of the
galaxy, but by comparing the movement of stars around the galaxy with the gas
ionised by newly formed stars in the minispiral, we now know that they are in
fact rotating in the same direction. Such a detailed map is possible due to the
Integral Field Unit (IFU) on VIMOS, allowing astronomers to study the gas in NGC
7252 with a comprehensive “mosaic” view. Much like the way a fly observes the
world, an IFU divides its subject into many cells, or pixels, generating a
spectrum for every single one. The resulting information is arranged into a 3D
data cube, which is particularly useful in studying extended objects in just one
shot.

text> This ghostly image features a distant and pulsating red giant star known
as R Sculptoris. Situated 1200 light-years away in the constellation of
Sculptor, R Sculptoris is something known as a carbon-rich asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star, meaning that it is nearing the end of its life. At this
stage, low- and intermediate-mass stars cool off, create extended atmospheres,
and lose a lot of their mass — they are on their way to becoming spectacular
planetary nebulae. While the basics of this mass-loss process are understood,
astronomers are still investigating how it begins near the surface of the star.
The amount of mass lost by a star actually has huge implications for its stellar
evolution, altering its future, and leading to different types of planetary
nebulae. As AGB stars end their lives as planetary nebulae, they produce a vast
range of elements — including 50% of elements heavier than iron — which are then
released into the Universe and used to make new stars, planets, moons, and
eventually the building blocks of life. One particularly intriguing feature of R
Sculptoris is its dominant bright spot, which looks to be two or three times
brighter than the other regions. The astronomers that captured this wonderful
image, using ESO’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), have concluded
that R Sculptoris is surrounded by giant “clumps” of stellar dust that are
peeling away from the shedding star. This bright spot is, in fact, a region
around the star with little to no dust, allowing us to look deeper into the
stellar surface. This image captures an extremely small section of the sky:
approximately 20x20 milliarcseconds. For comparison, Jupiter has an angular size
of approximately 40 arcseconds. Links Research paper

text> Nestled in the young Ophiuchus star-forming region, 410 light-years from
the Sun, a fascinating protoplanetary disc named AS 209 is slowly being carved
into shape. This wonderful image was captured using the high-resolution ALMA
telescope, revealing a curious pattern of rings and gaps in the dust surrounding
a young star. Protoplanetary discs are dense, rotating planes of gas and dust
that surround newly formed stars; providing the matter that one day becomes
orbiting planets, moons and other minor bodies. At less than one million years
old, this system is very young, but already two clear gaps are being sculpted
from the disc. The outer gap is deep, wide, and largely a dust-free zone,
leading astronomers to believe that a giant planet almost the mass of Saturn is
orbiting here — around 800 light-minutes from the central star, and more than
three times the distance between Neptune and the Sun! As the planet carves out
its path, dust piles up at the outer edge of its orbit, creating ever more
defined rings in the disc. The thinner, inner dust gap could have been formed by
a smaller planet, but astronomers have raised the intriguing possibility that
the large and distant circling planet in fact created both paths. This inferred
Saturn-like planet so far from its central star raises fascinating questions
about planet formation at the edges of protoplanetary discs on particularly
short timescales. Link: Research paper

text> This unique image from ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope (VST) reveals two
galaxies at the very beginning of the merging process. The interactions between
the duo have created a rare effect known as a light echo, where light
reverberates around the material within each galaxy. This is analogous to the
acoustic echo where the reflected sound arrives at the listener with a delay
after the direct sound. This is the first case of a light echo observed between
two galaxies. The larger galaxy, seen here in yellow, is ShaSS 073 — an active
galaxy with an extremely luminous core. Its less massive companion, in blue, is
named ShaSS 622, and together the pair make up the intriguing ShaSS 622-073
system. The bright core of ShaSS 073 is exciting a region of gas within the disc
of its blue companion: it bombards the material there with radiation, causing it
to glow brightly as it absorbs and then re-emits this light. This glowing region
extends across 1.8 billions of square light-years. However, while studying this
merger, astronomers found the luminosity of the large central galaxy to be 20
times lower than needed to excite the gas in this way. This indicates that the
centre of ShaSS 073 has dramatically faded over the last 30 000 years or so —
but the highly-ionised region between the two galaxies still retains the memory
of its former glory. Links Annotated version Paper by Merluzzi et al.

text> A sinister smile appears amid a sea of stars in this image — a small
portion of a gigantic gigapixel colour mosaic of the Milky Way’s heart.
Comprised of thousands of incredibly detailed images taken by ESO’s Visible and
Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA), the mosaic reveals more of the
stars at the Milky Way’s heart than ever before. VISTA was chosen due to its
extremely sensitive infrared camera, which can see through most of the dust that
blocks our view towards the centre of the galaxy. What we see in this image is a
dense patch of gas and dust — a nebula — that even VISTA’s camera cannot see
through. Located near the Lagoon Nebula (not seen), it appears to wink back as
it mischievously blocks out the light from background stars. The full image
contains almost nine billion pixels, and is part of the Vista Variables in the
Via Lactea (VVV) survey, a project to image the Milky Way’s bulge and disc at
near-infrared wavelengths. To create the colour mosaic, images at three
different wavelengths were seamlessly combined. The full zoomable image can be
explored online.

text> Two spiral galaxies are locked in a spellbinding, swirling dance in this
image from the VIMOS instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT). The two
interacting galaxies — NGC 5426 and NGC 5427 — together form an intriguing
astronomical object named Arp 271, the subject of this, the final image captured
by VIMOS before it was decommissioned on 24 March 2018. VIMOS — or, in full, the
VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph — was active on the VLT for an impressive 16
years. During that time it helped scientists to uncover the wild early lives of
massive galaxies, observe awe-inspiring triple-galaxy interactions, and explore
deep cosmic questions such as how the Universe’s most massive galaxies grew so
large. Instead of focusing on single objects, VIMOS was able to capture detailed
information about hundreds of galaxies at once. This sensitive instrument
collected the spectra of tens of thousands of galaxies throughout the Universe,
showing how they formed, grew, and evolved. Arp 271 is framed against a backdrop
of distant galaxies in this view, and wisps of bluish gas, dust and young stars
can be seen bridging the gap between the two galaxies — a result of their mutual
gravitational interaction. Like many astronomical observations, this image looks
back in time. Thanks to the vast gulf of space separating the Earth and Arp 271,
this image shows how the galaxies looked over 110 million years ago: the amount
of time it has taken their light to reach us. This kind of collision and merger
is also thought to be the eventual fate of the Milky Way, which scientists
believe will undergo a similar interaction with our neighbouring galaxy
Andromeda.

text> This ESO Picture of the Week shows the centre of a galaxy named NGC 5643.
This galaxy is located 55 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of
Lupus (The Wolf), and is known as a Seyfert galaxy. Seyfert galaxies have very
luminous centres — thought to be powered by material being accreted onto a
supermassive black hole lurking within — that can also be shrouded and obscured
by clouds of dust and intergalactic material. As a result, it can be difficult
to observe the active centre of a Seyfert galaxy. NGC 5643 poses a further
challenge; it is viewed at a high inclination, making it even trickier to view
its inner workings. However, scientists have used the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) together with archival data from the Multi
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope to
reveal this view of NGC 5643 — complete with energetic outflowing ionised gas
pouring out into space. These impressive outflows stretch out on either side of
the galaxy, and are caused by matter being ejected from the accretion disc of
the supermassive black hole at NGC 5643’s core. Combined, the ALMA and VLT data
show the galaxy’s central region to have two distinct components: a spiraling,
rotating disc (visible in red) consisting of cold molecular gas traced by carbon
monoxide, and the outflowing gas, traced by ionised oxygen and hydrogen (in
blue-orange hues) perpendicular to the inner nuclear disc.

text> This image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
shows MWC 758, a young star that is approaching adulthood and surrounded by
knotty, irregular rings of cosmic dust, three of which can be seen here.
Unusually, these rings are elliptical in shape rather than being perfectly
circular — making this the first discovery of an intrinsically elliptical
protoplanetary disc with ALMA! The outer and inner rings each contain one
particularly bright clump, visible as arcs of yellow. Additionally there appear
to be spiral arms traced out within the dust, as well as a core dust-free cavity
that is slightly off-centre. These are all features that hint at the presence of
unseen planets. As planets form, they gravitationally interact with the disc and
create various telltale features and structures. Astronomers can thus observe a
system like MWC 758 and not only infer the existence of potential hidden
planets, but also estimate their masses, locations, and orbits. This is a
wonderful example of the planet-finding power of ALMA. Using the observatory to
study such dusty discs allows scientists to investigate the very first stages of
planet formation in a bid to understand how these infant systems form and
evolve. Learning more about planetary systems throughout the cosmos may help us
know more about how the Solar System formed, and how it evolved to become the
cosmic home we live in today.

text> This ESO Picture of the Week shows a crescent-shaped cocoon of gas and
dust — a nebula known as NGC 3199, which lies 12 000 light-years away from
Earth. It appears to plough through the star-studded sky like a ship through
stormy seas. This imagery is very appropriate due to NGC 3199’s location in
Carina — a southern constellation which is named after the keel of a ship! NGC
3199 was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel in 1834 as he compiled
his famous catalogue of interesting night sky objects. The nebula has been the
subject of numerous observations since, including those by ESO’s 8.2-metre Very
Large Telescope (eso0310, eso1117), and 2.6-metre VLT Survey Telescope (VST).
The latter made the observations that comprise this image. The nebula’s bright
crescent feature is now known to be part of a much larger but fainter bubble of
gas and dust. The nebula contains a notable star named HD 89358, which is an
unusual type of extremely hot and massive star known as a Wolf-Rayet star. HD
89358 generates incredibly intense stellar winds and outflows that smash into
and sweep up the surrounding material, contributing to NGC 3199’s twisted and
lopsided morphology. The VST, which began operations in 2011, can image a large
area of sky at once — an area twice the size of the full Moon — with its
256-megapixel camera, OmegaCAM. This allows it to characterise interesting
objects which its larger neighbour, ESO’s Very Large Telescope, can then explore
in even greater detail.

text> This image shows a dwarf galaxy in the southern constellation of Phoenix
named, for obvious reasons, the Phoenix Dwarf. The Phoenix Dwarf is unique in
that it cannot be classified according to the usual scheme for dwarf galaxies;
while its shape would label it as a spheroidal dwarf galaxy — which do not
contain enough gas to form new stars — studies have shown the galaxy to have an
associated cloud of gas nearby, hinting at recent star formation, and a
population of young stars. The gas cloud does not lie within the galaxy itself,
but is still gravitationally bound to it — meaning that it will eventually fall
back into the galaxy over time. Since the cloud is close by, it’s likely that
the process that flung it outwards it is still ongoing. After studying the shape
of the gas cloud, astronomers suspect the most likely cause of the ejection to
be supernova explosions within the galaxy. The data to create this image was
selected from the ESO archive as part of the Hidden Treasure competition.

text> This object is possibly the oldest of its kind ever catalogued: the
hourglass-shaped remnant named CK Vulpeculae. Originally thought to be a nova,
classifying this unusually shaped object correctly has proven challenging over
the years. A number of possible explanations for its origins have been
considered and discarded. It is now thought to be the result of two stars
colliding — although there is still debate about what type of stars they were.
CK Vulpeculae was first spotted on 20 June 1670 by French monk and astronomer
Père Dom Anthelme. When it first appeared it was easily visible with the naked
eye; over the subsequent two years the flare varied in brightness and
disappeared and reappeared twice, before finally vanishing from view for good.
During the twentieth century, astronomers came to understand that most novae
could be explained by the runaway explosive behaviour and interactions between
two close stars in a binary system. The features seen around CK Vulpeculae
didn’t seem to fit this model particularly well,however, puzzling astronomers
for many years. The central part of the remnant has now been studied in detail
using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This striking
image shows the best view of the object to date, and traces the cosmic dust and
emission within and around CK Vulpeculae to reveal its intricate structure. CK
Vulpeculae harbours a warped dusty disc at its centre and gaseous jets which
indicate some central system propelling material outwards. These new
observations are the first to bring this system into focus, suggesting a
solution to a 348 year-old mystery.

text> This image from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
shows the area surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole that
lurks at the centre of the Milky Way — highlighted here with a small circle. New
research has revealed exciting evidence of interstellar gas and dust orbiting
the black hole at high speeds. The molecular-hydrogen-rich gas clouds which have
been identified are known as molecular cloudlets, and they have never before
been unambiguously detected. This image actually shows the distribution of
molecules including carbon monoxide, the cloudlets’ second most abundant
molecular component. The cloudlets lie 26 000 light-years away from us, orbiting
fast and relatively close to the black hole, at a distance of about one light
year. ALMA’s high resolution allowed scientists to detect the cloudlets, which
are the products of pre-existing massive clouds rotating around the centre of
our galaxy. These clouds were tidally disrupted into dense fragments and a lower
density, short-lived component. The latter was identified thanks to the signs
left by the passage of the synchrotron radiation emitted by Sagittarius A*
through diffuse gas between the cloudlets. Although clouds of molecular gas have
the potential to form new stars, these cloudlets are unlikely to create stellar
newborns. They have a comparatively small mass of around 60 times that of the
Sun, and exist close to the huge, turbulent, punishing gravitational forces
exerted by Sagittarius A*. While the stars orbiting Sagittarius A* have been
systematically observed, these dense molecular cloudlets have not been detected
so close to the centre of our galaxy before.

text> This colourful image shows a part of the Rosette Nebula in the
constellation of Monoceros (The Unicorn). It is an emission nebula, composed of
clouds of gas that are made to glow by the radiation emanating from stars
within. The Rosette Nebula is a fairly typical example of an emission nebula —
but typical does not mean boring! Nebulae are some of the most beautiful
celestial objects out there, and they frequently show up spectacularly in images
taken by astronomical telescopes, as seen here. In nebulae such as this, gas and
dust are combining to produce a new generation of stars. Initially these
newly-formed stars are shrouded in the dusty clouds that gave them birth, and
cannot be seen in visible light. But after a while they blow away the denser
material and their powerful radiation pours out to ionise the surrounding gas,
causing it to glow brightly. These elements are all present in this image — the
mixture of glowing gas and dark dust has been sculpted into complex patterns on
the sky by the stellar radiation, like smoke around a fire. This particular
image was obtained with the FORS 2 instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope,
sited in the harsh environment of Chile’s Atacama Desert. FORS 2 is an extremely
versatile instrument that can produce very high-quality images (like this one!).
It is also a spectrograph that can split the light it collects into a rainbow of
colours, giving astronomers information about the chemical composition of
objects across the Universe. This image was created as part of the ESO Cosmic
Gems programme, an outreach initiative to produce images of interesting,
intriguing or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes
of education and public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that
cannot be used for science observations. All data collected may also be suitable
for scientific purposes, and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s
science archive.

text> This spectacular Picture of the Week was produced from data gathered by
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, combined with
data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. It shows a cluster of stars named
Westerlund 1, one of the most massive young star clusters known to reside in the
Milky Way. Excitingly, it also shows the comet-like “tails” of material
stretching away from some of the giant stars in Westerlund 1. Such tails are
formed in the thick, relentless winds that pour from the cluster’s stellar
residents, carrying material outwards. This phenomenon is similar to how comets
get their famous and beautiful tails. Comet tails in the Solar System are driven
away from the nucleus of their parent comet by a wind of particles that streams
out from the Sun. Consequently comet tails always point away from our Sun.
Similarly, the tails of the huge red stars shown in this image point away from
the core of the cluster, likely the result of powerful cluster winds generated
by the hundreds of hot and massive stars found towards the centre of Westerlund
1. These massive structures cover large distances and indicate the dramatic
effect the environment can have on how the stars form and evolve. These
comet-like tails were detected during an ALMA study of Westerlund 1 that aimed
to explore the cluster’s constituent stars and figure out how, and at what rate,
they lose their mass. The cluster is known to host a large amount of massive
stars, many of them intriguing and rare types, making it of great interest and
use to astronomers wishing to understand the myriad stars in our galaxy.

text> This image reveals a dramatic binary star system named R Aquarii, located
700 light-years from Earth, as seen in 2012 by ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT).
R Aquarii is a so-called “symbiotic binary”, comprising two stars surrounded by
a large, dynamic cloud of gas (a nebula). Systems like this contain two stars in
an unequal and complex relationship. R Aquarii is made up of one hot white dwarf
and one red giant. The red giant is losing matter to its small companion and
occasionally ejecting matter in weird spurts, loops and trails, forming the
intriguing shapes seen here. There is a lot going on between the performers in
this cosmic double act. The red giant is a variable star, with a brightness that
changes by a factor of 750 every year and three weeks. The faint nebula is named
Cederblad 211 and is thought to be the result of a violent nova 250 years ago.
Also visible is a narrow, vertical, S-shaped feature, with blobs of superheated
material moving outward at tremendous speeds of 600 to 850 kilometres per
second. R Aquarii was also imaged 15 years ago — and several times in the
intervening period — to track its ongoing activity. The system is very dynamic
and complex, and has expanded and evolved significantly in recent years (an
image from 1997 can be seen here, and a comparison between the two is available
here).

Aquarii, as seen in 1997 by the Nordic Optical Telescope on the island of La
Palma, Spain. In the 15 years since this image was taken the system has been
observed many more times by other telescopes, including ESO’s Very Large
Telescope, and has been seen to be expanding and evolving in shape. An image
from 2012 can be seen here.

text> Nuzzled in the chest of the constellation Virgo (the Virgin) lies a
beautiful cosmic gem — the galaxy Messier 61. This glittering spiral galaxy is
aligned face-on towards Earth, thus presenting us with a breathtaking view of
its structure. The gas and dust of the intricate spiral arms are studded with
billions of stars. This galaxy is a bustling hub of activity with a rapid rate
of star formation, and both a massive nuclear star cluster and a supermassive
black hole buried at its heart. Messier 61 is one of the largest members of the
Virgo Cluster, which is made up of more than a thousand galaxies, and is itself
at the centre of the Virgo Supercluster — to which our Milky Way also belongs.
This dazzling beauty was first discovered in 1779, and it has been capturing
astronomers’ interest ever since. Set against a dark sky littered with galaxies,
this image shows the awe-inspiring M61 in its full glory — even at its distance
of over 50 million light-years. This image was taken as part of ESO’s Cosmic
Gems Programme, an outreach initiative to produce images of interesting,
intriguing or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes
of education and public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that
cannot be used for science observations. In case the data collected could be
useful for future scientific purposes, these observations are saved and made
available to astronomers through ESO’s Science Archive.

text> This week’s Picture of the Week focuses on one of twenty protoplanetary
discs explored and imaged by ALMA’s first Large Program, known as the Disk
Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP). The disc is called AS
209, and its substructures are particularly pronounced thanks to its thin,
high-contrast rings and almost face-on orientation towards us. Though concentric
rings — shown here in particularly beautiful clarity — are a common substructure
among such discs, their widths, separations, and number can vary greatly. It’s
still unclear how these substructures form, and how planets emerge from them.
Quantifying and studying these similarities and differences was a motivator for
constructing ALMA, and was the main objective of DSHARP. These details may hold
clues to the type of planetary system that will eventually emerge. One
interpretation is that there may be a rapid and complex interplay between young
protoplanets and the disc itself far earlier in the evolution of the planetary
system than previously thought. A leading theory of planet formation requires
dust within these discs to clump into grains, then pebbles, and eventually
planetesimals. This theory has always been stumped, however, by the fact that
once an object reaches a certain mass, the dynamics of these discs would cause
it to be sucked into the host star at the centre, thus halting its growth into a
true planet. The results from the DSHARP program suggest that disc substructures
may perturb these dynamics and provide safe havens where young planetesimals can
continue growing — making the substructures observed here crucial to our own
existence. Next week’s picture will be the final instalment in the DSHARP
series, and will showcase another of the twenty images: this time a multiple
star system.

text> This week’s Picture of the Week highlights another of the 20 images to
come out of ALMA’s first Large Program, the Disk Substructures at High Angular
Resolution Project (DSHARP). DSHARP explored a number of nearby protoplanetary
discs to learn more about the earliest stages of planet formation, and a
staggering quantity of data from the project has just been released. This
object, called AS 205, is notable for being a multiple star system, one of two
such systems imaged by DSHARP (the other being HT Lup). While two discs are
discernible here, the lower right disc is in fact shared by two stars in a
binary system, so we are actually looking at a system of three fledgling stars.
Although most high-resolution studies have so far focused on single stars,
multiple systems are far from uncommon in the Universe. It is thought that over
half of all stars may exist in multiple systems, an estimate that may be even
higher for young stars. The presence of companion stars is likely to have
complex implications for a disc and its substructures. This is due to as the
gravitational influence of a stellar neighbour, which may distort and
redistribute the material within the disc. Data from AS 205 and HT Lup indicate
that stars and their neighbouring discs interact strongly. Despite their
unsettled birth environments, planets have been detected in multiple stellar
systems — some orbiting just one of the stars, others orbiting the entire
system. The latter are more likely to have stable orbits than the former, which
get caught up in volatile interstellar dynamics.

text> This Picture of the Week is a special treat: a first-light image from the
newest resident of ESO’s Paranal Observatory, the SPECULOOS Southern
Observatory. This planet-hunting machine aims to observe nearby but dim stars to
locate exoplanets for other telescopes — such as ESO’s forthcoming Extremely
Large Telescope (ELT) — to study in detail. Comprising four one-metre
telescopes, each named after one of Jupiter’s Galilean moons, SPECULOOS promises
to open up new frontiers in exoplanet research. This image, however, is
obviously not of a faint star, but of a galaxy called NGC 6902. Before a
telescope starts its primary mission it must successfully undertake an event
called “first light”: the first time it is used for a scientific observation.
Astronomers typically pick well-known objects for this initial test of a
telescope’s capabilities, which is half demonstration and half celebration. In
this case, the team settled on NGC 6902 as the first-light target for the
Ganymede telescope. The result was this stunning image of the spiral galaxy,
which is found about 120 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of
Sagittarius (The Archer). The galaxy’s spiral arms swirl outwards from a bright
centre until they dissolve into streams of blue haze at the galaxy’s edge. If
this is what Ganymede can produce as its first observation of something it
wasn’t even designed to image, we have a lot to look forward to. Watch this
space!

text> If you had a brand new state-of-the-art telescope facility, what would you
look at first? Researchers at the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory — which
comprises four small telescopes, each with a 1-metre primary mirror — chose to
view the Lagoon Nebula. This magnificent picture is the result, and is one of
the SPECULOOS’ first ever observations. The nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in
our galaxy where new stars are being born, and is found roughly 5000 light-years
from us. This striking image is made even more impressive by the fact that the
SPECULOOS isn’t actually designed to study nebulae. The name says it all —
SPECULOOS, the Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars. In other
words, the primary mission of this telescope facility is to find Earth-like
planets orbiting faint nearby stars. The candidates it discovers will be passed
over to larger telescopes, such as ESO’s forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT), to be studied in more detail. SPECULOOS is located at ESO’s Paranal
Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile, taking full advantage of the
location’s dark skies, ideal atmospheric conditions, and the support systems ESO
has there, from telescope infrastructure to staff accommodation. It will have a
partner, the SPECULOOS Northern Observatory, in the Canary Islands, which will
hunt for planets in the northern skies not visible from Chile. Together they
promise to vastly expand our knowledge of the exoplanets in our neighbourhood.

text> It’s impossible to miss the star in this ESO Picture of the Week — beaming
proudly from the centre of the frame is the massive multiple star system Tau
Canis Majoris, the brightest member of the Tau Canis Majoris Cluster (NGC 2362)
in the eponymous constellation of Canis Major (The Great Dog). Tau Canis Majoris
aside, the cluster is populated by many young and less attention-seeking stars
that are only four or five million years old, all just beginning their cosmic
lifetimes. The Tau Canis Majoris Cluster is an open cluster — a group of stars
born from the same molecular cloud. This means that all of the cluster’s
inhabitants share a common chemical composition and are loosely bound together
by gravity. Having been born together, they make an ideal stellar laboratory to
test theories of stellar evolution, the chain of events that leads from a star’s
birth in a cool, dense cloud of gas through to its eventual death. Though the
stars in this image were all created at the same time, their various different
masses mean they will lead very different lives. As Tau Canis Majoris is one of
the most massive and short-lived types of star, it will burn through its nuclear
fuel long before its smaller companions, which will keep on shining for billions
of years. This image was created as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an
outreach initiative to produce images of interesting, intriguing or visually
attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and
public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that cannot be used

text> This is one of 74 nearby galaxies whose stellar nurseries were recently
observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, in an
astronomical census called Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS
(PHANGS). So far, around 100 000 of these stellar nurseries have been imaged in
over 750 hours of observation. ALMA’s remarkable sensitivity provides data at
high enough resolution to study these regions in detail, and shows that some are
bursting with new stars, while others evolve more gradually. This anticipated
diversity in the process of how stars form was the motivation behind this
enormous effort. There have long been theories that aimed to explain how and why
these differences might occur, some involving the characteristics of the home
galaxy itself — properties such as size, age, and internal dynamics — but our
lack of high-resolution data had been an obstacle to testing them. The vast
quantity and variety of data yielded by PHANGS are already helping astronomers
to understand more, even though the census is only a third complete. The project
aims to observe a total of about 300 000 stellar nurseries and by the end it
should significantly advance our understanding of how a galaxy’s properties
influence the way in which it forms new stars.

text> The constellation of Orion (The Hunter) is one of the most recognisable
collections of stars in the night sky. We have noted Orion’s prominent stars for
tens of thousands of years at least, and likely far longer. Chinese astronomers
called it 参宿 or Shēn, literally “three stars”, for its three bright dots (which
form the Hunter’s belt). The ancient Egyptians regarded it as the gods Sah and
Sopdet, manifestations of Osiris and Isis, respectively, whereas Greek
astronomers saw a brave hunter — the eponymous Orion — with his sword above his
head, ready to strike. Mythology aside, Orion is a fascinating patch of sky.
This image, from ESO’s Very Large Telescope, shows a reflection nebula nestled
at the heart of the constellation — NGC 2023. Located close to the well-known
Horsehead and Flame Nebulae, NGC 2023 lurks about 1500 light-years away from
Earth, and is one of the largest reflection nebulae in the sky. Reflection
nebulae are clouds of interstellar dust that reflect the light from nearby or
internal sources, like fog around a car headlight. NGC 2023 is illuminated by a
massive young star named HD 37903. The star is extremely hot — several times
hotter than the Sun — and its bright blue-white light causes NGC 2023’s milky
glow. Such nebulae are often the birthplaces of stars, and contain a clumpy
distribution of gas that’s significantly denser than the surrounding medium.
Under the influence of gravity, these clumps attract one another and merge,
eventually creating a new star. In a few million years time, Orion’s Belt may
gain a new star! The image was taken with the VLT’s FORS (FOcal Reducer and
Spectrograph) instrument as part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme. This
initiative produces images of interesting and visually attractive objects using
ESO telescopes, for the purposes of education and outreach. The programme makes

text> This red-hued cloud of gas is named Abell 24, and is located in the
constellation of Canis Minor (The Lesser Dog). It is something known as a
planetary nebula — a burst of gas and dust created when a star dies and throws
its outer layers into space. Despite the name, planetary nebulae have nothing to
do with planets. The term was coined by William Herschel, who also famously
discovered Uranus; in a time of low-resolution astronomy, these nebulous objects
appeared to resemble giant planets swimming in a dark cosmos. A Sun-like star
spends most of its life converting hydrogen into helium in its core. In its
twilight years the star runs out of fuel and becomes unbalanced; it can no
longer resist the inward crush of gravity and the core begins to collapse. The
temperature in the core rises dramatically while the cooler outer layers expand,
causing the entire star to bloat into a red giant. When the Sun begins its
transformation into a red giant it will expand to completely engulf the
innermost planets and possibly also the Earth, growing to over 250 times its
current radius! Strong winds then expel the gaseous outer layers of the star,
forming a shell of gas that spreads out into the vastness of space. The red
giant’s venting atmosphere will eventually expose its hot, luminous remnant
core, which will emit fierce ultraviolet radiation and ionise the surrounding
gas. This image shows the faint nebulous glow of a stellar swansong — the bright
remnant of a long-dead star. Taken with the VLT’s FORS (FOcal Reducer and
Spectrograph) instrument, this image is part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme,
an initiative to produce images of scientifically interesting and visually
attractive objects using ESO telescopes for the purposes of education and public

text> This is SS 433, a microquasar first discovered forty years ago and located
about 18 000 light-years away in the constellation of Aquila (The Eagle). This
image, captured for the very first time at submillimeter wavelengths by the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), is special because it shows
the jets emitted by a hot, swirling disc of material encircling the black hole
at SS 433’s centre. Owing to its relative proximity, SS 433 is a particularly
useful object for researchers looking to learn more about microquasars and the
jets they emit. The corkscrew shape visible here is created by a phenomenon
known as precession; as they move outwards through space, these two jets are
slowly tumbling around an axis in a similar way to the motion of a gyroscope or
a spinning top slowing down, the orientation of their rotational axes changing
as they do so. The scale of this corkscrew is enormous, at 5000 times the size
of the Solar System. One remarkable aspect of this observation is that its
detailed shape was entirely predicted from spectroscopic measurements by the
Global Jet Watch telescopes in the preceding year before the ALMA observations
were made. The sequence of these observations allowed researchers to make and
test predictions about the paths the jets would take, representing a new
milestone in the study of microquasars. The observations have also resolved the
question of why the jets are still hot at such great distances from their origin
— ALMA’s sensitivity enabled researchers to identify that reheating of the
plasma occurs when successive jet surges expand and collide with one another.

text> This spectacular portrait of the Centaurus A galaxy was captured under
clear skies by the newest operational ESO observatory, SPECULOOS (Search for
habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars), located at the Paranal
Observatory in Chile. The state of the art observatory is fitted an array of
four one-metre telescopes, each named after one of the four Galilean moons. The
SPECULOOS telescopes are neighbours of two of ESO’s most powerful telescopes,
the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and VISTA. SPECULOOS is set to survey up to ten
times more red dwarf stars than the TRAPPIST telescope (located at ESO La Silla
Observatory) currently does. It is predicted statistically that it will then
find at least twelve solar systems of a similar size to the now famous
TRAPPIST-1 system. The Centaurus A galaxy (NGC 5128) is one of the brightest
galaxies in the southern hemisphere night sky, located in the constellation of
Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop at the
former Parramata Observatory. At a distance of 11 million light-years, it is the
closest active galactic nucleus (AGN) to us. Astronomers theorise that what was
originally an elliptical galaxy collided with a relatively smaller spiral shaped
galaxy, giving it the peculiar shape we see now. NGC 5128 has an impressive
collection of stars. From this image, you can observe red/pink star-forming
regions on the bottom left of the image and young blue star clusters on the top
right of the image; with dust lanes captured in stunning detail. Towards the
centre of the galaxy, leftover cosmic dust is slowly being eaten by the
supermassive black hole, which has a mass of roughly 100 million solar masses.
This accretion of matter results in powerful radio waves being emitted from the
AGN. This image was taken as one of the first light images from the SPECULOOS
telescopes. First light images are the very first images that are taken by a
telescope when it is being commissioned for science operation to guarantee that
it is in good working order and that the images are clear.

text> NGC 3351, also known as Messier 95, was first discovered in 1781 by Pierre
Méchain, a French astronomer and surveyor who worked alongside Charles Messier.
NGC 3351 is a type of galaxy known as a barred spiral galaxy and it is located
in the constellation of Leo (The Lion). New observations of this object have
shown stellar feedback in action. Stellar feedback is the process of
redistributing energy into the interstellar medium (the space in between the
stars) within star-forming galaxies. In this particular galaxy, star formation
is occurring in the ring surrounding the galaxy nucleus at such a violent rate
that massive bubbles of hot gas can actually be seen being ejected. This ejected
gas can then contribute (both positively and negatively) to ongoing star
formation within the galaxy. The data for this observation were taken with ALMA,
the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, showing once
again that scientific collaboration across multiple facilities can produce some
wonderful results.

text> Using the detailed eyes of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) and ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have mapped the
intense tails of a cosmic jellyfish: a number of knotty streams of gas spewing
outwards from a spiral galaxy named ESO 137-001. This celestial cnidarian is
shown here in beautiful detail. The various elements making up this image were
captured by different telescopes. The galaxy and its surroundings were imaged by
the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope; its tails, which trace streams of hydrogen
and show up in hues of bright purple, by the MUSE instrument mounted on the VLT;
and bright hotspots of carbon oxide emission from within the system, which show
up as flares of orange-red, were spotted by ALMA. These tails are caused by a
dramatic phenomenon known as ram-pressure stripping. The space between galaxies
in a cluster is not empty, but full of material that acts like a viscous fluid.
As a galaxy travels through this resistant environment, gas is stripped out of
the galaxy to form a wake that creates beautiful, intricate systems such as that
seen here around ESO 137-001 (which resides in the Norma galaxy cluster). The
direction and position of the tail shed light on the way in which the galaxy is
moving — with galaxies usually falling towards the centre of the cluster itself.
This image offers the first high-resolution map of the cold molecular gas
lurking within a ram-pressure stripped system. ESO 137-001 is one of the nearest
jellyfish galaxies to Earth, and is particularly interesting because its long,
extended tails of gas contain features known as ‘fireballs’: bursts of star
formation. The precise mechanisms governing how stars form within jellyfish
tails are mysterious, and this map thus provides a new window onto the
conditions needed for new stars to form in such intense, changeable
environments. The ALMA array comprises 66 antennas, and is located on the
Chajinator plateau in the Chilean Atacama Desert at an altitude of 5000 metres.
ALMA observes the night sky from this remote location to unlock the secrets of
how the Universe — and its weird and wonderful residents, ESO 137-001 included —
formed and evolved, revealing more about our cosmic origins.

text> This strikingly simple and serene view of NGC 1404 — a giant elliptical
galaxy located 62 million light-years away in the constellation of Fornax (The
Furnace) — hides the galaxy’s cruel reality. NGC 1404 is one of the galaxies
comprising the massive Fornax Cluster — and it is slowly falling inwards towards
the cluster’s core. As it moves towards the cluster’s large centremost galaxy,
NGC 1399, the galaxy’s reserves of hot gas are being forcibly ripped and
stripped away, leaving an elongated tell-tale trail of gas in its wake. While
not visible in this image, this gas stream can be seen clearly in X-ray images
of the galaxy; in time, NGC 1404 will lose most of its hot gas, and therefore
its ability to form new stars. ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) captured this
image of NGC 1404 with its FORS instrument. The bright foreground star to the
lower left of the frame is named HD 22862.

text> This cloud-strewn new image of RCW 36 (or Gum 20) was captured by ESO’s
Focal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS). It shows one of the sites
of massive-star formation closest to our Solar System, about 2300 light-years
away. Located in the constellation of Vela (The Sails), the RCW 36 emission
nebula is only part of an even larger star formation complex, known as the Vela
Molecular Ridge. Some areas in the clouds of RCW 36 are dense enough to block
out background light, creating patches and wisps of inky black. Despite the dark
appearance of these clouds, they are the only places in the Universe in which
star formation occurs; clumps of molecular hydrogen and cosmic dust collapse and
come together to form stars encircled by small families of planets, as in our
own Solar System. FORS is mounted on ESO’s Very Large Telescope, one of the
world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. This image was selected as
part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an initiative that produces images of
scientifically interesting and visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes
for the purposes of education and public outreach. The programme makes use of
telescope time that cannot be used for science observations. All data collected
may also be suitable for scientific purposes, and are made available to

text> The Milky Way contains many regions of starbirth — areas where new stars
are springing to life within collapsing clumps of gas and dust. One such region,
named Gum 26, is shown here as imaged by the FORS instrument on ESO’s Very Large
Telescope in Chile. Gum 26 is located roughly 20,000 light-years away in the
southern constellation of Vela (The Sails). It is something known as an HII
region or emission nebula, where the intense ultraviolet radiation streaming
from newly-formed stars ionises the surrounding hydrogen gas, causing it to emit
a faint pinkish glow. By catching new stars “pink-handed” in this manner,
astronomers can learn more about the conditions under which stars arise, and
study how they influence their cosmic environment. This image was created as
part of the ESO Cosmic Gems programme, an outreach initiative to produce images
of interesting, intriguing or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes,

text> This image shows a pair of interacting galaxies known as Arp 271.
Individually, these galaxies are named NGC 5426 and NGC 5427; both are spirals,
and both are roughly the same size. Some astronomers believe that these galaxies
are in the process of merging to form a single entity. This interaction will
create increasing numbers of new stars over the next few million years, some of
which can be seen within the “bridge” of gas connecting the two galaxies. This
kind of collision and interaction might also happen to our own galaxy, the Milky
Way, which is likely to collide with the neighbouring Andromeda Galaxy in about
five billion years time. These galaxies lie over 120 million light years away
from us, and were discovered by the German-British astronomer William Herschel
in 1785. Herschel was a prolific scientist, also discovering both infrared
radiation and the planet Uranus. Link: Previous release of the same galaxy pair:

text> This beautiful image, captured with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion
Spectrograph (FORS) on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), shows a field of stars
of all ages — some looming close in the foreground, and others lurking in the
far distance. The distinct red and blue hues are thanks to the use of filters,
which allow the selection of specific wavelength ranges of light. The images
collected with different filters can be combined in order to create colourful
composite images: by assigning a particular color to each filter; colouring the
images according to the filter used; then combining the separate images. The
result is a spectacular image which colourfully represents the various
wavelengths of light. This patch of sky is found in the constellation of Crux
(The Southern Cross), an extremely bright section of the Milky Way. It was

text> The MUSE instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile has
observed NGC 1365, a double-barred spiral galaxy located about 56 million
light-years away in the Fornax galaxy cluster, allowing us to construct this
spectacular colour image. The galaxy is also known as the Great Barred Spiral
Galaxy, after its two central bar-shaped structures, made up of stars. The two
bars of NGC 1365 are a rare phenomenon and are thought to have originated by the
combined effects of galaxy rotation and the complex dynamics of the stars. Its
largest bar of stars, too large for its structure to be visible in this image,
connects its outer spiral arms to its centre. What we can see is the much
smaller second bar of stars, nestled within the main bar. It is likely this
secondary bar acts independently of the main bar, rotating more rapidly than the
rest of the galaxy. Standing for Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, the MUSE
instrument captured this image in optical and infrared light, showing the gas
and dust in the central region of the galaxy. Installed on Yepun, one of the
four 8.2-metre telescopes that make up the VLT, the capabilities of this
instrument have allowed for some of the most comprehensive and detailed studies
of our Universe to date, including surveys of distant galaxies, supermassive
black holes and even the source of gravitational waves.

text> The ongoing large-scale ATOMIUM project is being conducted in
collaboration with ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, which
is located in Chile and has ESO as a partner.The project set out to map the
stellar winds blowing out from around a dozen red giant stars, an ambitious goal
made possible thanks to ALMA’s spectacular resolution. These stellar winds —
which are sometimes millions of times stronger than those of our Sun — were
expected to be spherical, like the parent stars that they are blasted away from.
However, researchers did not observe spherical stellar winds, but something
quite different. As seen in the above image — which shows winds around a star
called R Aquilae — the team found that in all cases the stellar winds were not
spherical, but had different shapes, including some resembling the delicate
petals of a rose. The patterns seen in the stellar winds have a striking
resemblance to those of planetary nebulae. The research team, led by Leen Decin
at KULeuven, Belgium, proposed that a process known as binary interaction is
responsible for the shape of the stellar winds of red giant stars. As the name
suggests, binary interaction involves two objects. The theory is that the
stellar winds achieve their shape due to the influence of another star, or a
giant planet. Stellar winds are the precursors to planetary nebulae, and the
apparent similarity in their structures indicates that the physics that shapes
stellar winds also shapes planetary nebulae, and hence that binary interaction
is the key agent carving out the planetary nebulae morphologies.

text> The thousands of newly formed stars at the heart of NGC 5236 were imaged
with the MUSE instrument, attached to ESO’s Very Large Telescope at Paranal
Observatory in Chile. Referred to mostly as the Southern Pinwheel galaxy, NGC
5236 receives its common name from its beautiful spiral arm configuration and
its location in a Southern Hemisphere constellation: Hydra. Bright regions of
star formation light up this galaxy, including the region imaged here, located
within the galaxy’s centre. With the right conditions, and commonly within the
spiral arms of a galaxy, cold molecular clouds mostly composed of hydrogen gas
can collapse and form into brand new stars. In larger clouds, the burning of a
new star can create a domino effect, initiating the collapse of the surrounding
gas into even more stars. Within a galaxy’s centre however, other processes are
at play. The supermassive black hole at the centre of NGC 5236 funnels vast
channels of material and matter towards itself; at the same time, it erratically
spits matter and large quantities of energy outwards, making the huge amount of
star formation around this galaxy’s central region extra messy.

text> Discovered in the year 1836 by John Herschel, NGC 6902 is a beautiful
spiral galaxy located more than 130 million light-years away in the
constellation of Sagittarius, the Archer. This image was taken with MUSE, the
Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer instrument attached to one of the four
8.2-metre telescopes that make up the VLT, and shows the galaxy from a unique
perspective. A zoom in towards the galaxy’s centre, the image shows a nuclear
ring where the orange glow of intense star formation is visible. Inside this
ring lies a faint and small bar of stars. Researchers found that stars within it
are distributed differently depending on their age, with younger stars aligned
along the bar and older stars more dispersed. These locations of the young and
old stars within the central bar of NGC 6902 confirm predictions made years
earlier from simulations and models. This is the first time these predictions of
galactic structure were confirmed with observations thanks to the incredible
spatial resolution of the MUSE instrument.

text> Appearing as a bird in flight, with wings outstretched in the expanse of
space, SU Aur, a star much younger and more massive than the Sun, is surrounded
by a giant planet-forming disc. This image, captured by the SPHERE instrument on
ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), shows the disc around SU Aur in unprecedented
detail, including the long dust trails connected to it. The star itself is
obscured by the instrument’s coronagraph, a device that blocks the light from
the central star to allow the less bright features around it to stand out. The
dust trails are composed of material from an encompassing nebula flowing into
the disc. This nebula is likely the outcome of a collision between the star and
a huge cloud of gas and dust, resulting in the unique shape of this
planet-forming disc and the surrounding dust structure. A new study of SU Aur,
which used the VLT and data from other telescopes, including the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, showed that the nebula is still feeding material
to the planet-forming disc. These new observations highlight how complex
planet-forming discs can be.

text> This gently glowing area of sky is actually a hot bubble of hydrogen gas —
named Sh 2-305 — that has been bombarded by intense radiation from nearby stars.
Such gas clouds are known as emission nebulae, or HII regions (pronounced
“H-two”). The radiation in question is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum
and is thought to emanate from at least two O-type stars, and likely several
others. This stellar class is the brightest and hottest that we know of — such
stars can be up to 90 times as massive as the Sun, and an incredible one million
times as bright. Together with five neighbouring bubbles, Sh 2-305 belongs to a
giant complex of dense clouds of dust and gas and, on a larger scale, an
enormous ring called the GS234-02 star-forming supershell (located in the
Perseus arm of the Milky Way, in the constellation of Puppis). This image was

text> Do you ever get the feeling that you’re being watched? This
friendly-looking object is the result of two galaxies merging into one another,
complete with a pair of eyes hiding two growing supermassive black holes and a
swirling grin. Such mergers are rare in our galactic neighbourhood; Mrk 739 is
close enough (astronomically speaking) to study the event in detail, and thus
gain a better understanding of the dramatic processes that take place during
these cosmic mergers. By using the MUSE instrument on ESO’s Very Large
Telescope, the team of astronomers, led by master’s student Dusán Tubín at the
Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, were able to study the effects of both
the merger and the radiation emitted by the growing gigantic black holes. Their
study answers questions about the motion of the galaxies, the age of their
stars, and the elements they are made up of. They have found that one of these
galaxies is much older than its companion, and that their merging process is at
an early stage. MUSE is a 3D spectrograph that takes images — known as
“datacubes” — of the object being observed over thousands of wavelengths. With
MUSE, astronomers are therefore able to map in great detail the properties of
the objects they study, because each individual pixel contains an impressive
amount of information. Obtaining these exciting insights into galaxy merging and
evolution with MUSE is enough to make anyone smile.

text> This week’s picture of the week features DG121, an HII region — a cloud of
ionised hydrogen — located in the constellation of Puppis (the Stern). HII
regions, a type of emission nebulae, are created when young, massive stars
release enough ultraviolet energy to ionise the surrounding gas clouds. These
regions tend to have irregular structures and lack sharp boundaries, giving them
their hazy, yet photogenic, appearance. The brightest star in the DG121 region,
seen near the centre in this picture, is HD 60068. This spectacular image was
taken with the FORS 2 (FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2)
instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope in the Chilean Atacama Desert. This

instruments at Paranal”, because of its ability to study many different
astronomical objects in many different ways.

text> If you look closely at the faint and fuzzy centre of this picture, you

ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope (VST). UDG stands for ultra-diffuse galaxy: objects
as large as the Milky Way but with 100 – 1000 times fewer stars. These galaxies
are extremely faint and lack star-forming gas, which makes them appear almost
like a fluffy cosmic cloud, or a smudge in space. Their origins remain
uncertain, but astronomers speculate that they could be “failed” galaxies that
lost their gas supply early in their lifetimes. This image of UDG4 was taken as
part of a study from a much larger program, the VST Early-type Galaxy Survey
(VEGAS), which aims to investigate very faint structures in galaxy clusters —
large groups of many galaxies bound together by gravity. The study, led by
Enrichetta Iodice from the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy, has found
several UDGs in the Hydra Cluster, but more observations are needed to elucidate
their true nature. Given their flimsy appearance, UDGs can be difficult to spot.
Nevertheless, the VST, equipped with its OmegaCAM camera, provides exquisite
sensitivity to light, allowing astronomers to study such elusive objects.

text> This ESO Picture of the Week features a galaxy named both NGC 4254 and
Messier 99, a beautiful cosmic spectacle located in the constellation of Coma
Berenices (Berenice’s Hair). Messier 99 is special, owing to its classification
as a grand design spiral galaxy: a kind of galactic architecture featuring
strong, prominent, well-defined arms that wrap clearly around the galaxy’s
centre. Only around 10 percent of all spirals are of the grand design variety,
making objects like Messier 99 somewhat uncommon. The justification behind
Messier 99’s categorisation is clear in this image; bright, swirling arms carve
through the dark surrounding space, and are easily identifiable as a number of
different, coherent structures. This image was created as part of the ESO Cosmic
Gems programme, an outreach initiative to produce images of interesting,
intriguing or visually attractive objects using ESO telescopes, for the purposes
of education and public outreach. The programme makes use of telescope time that
cannot be used for science observations. All data collected may also be suitable
for scientific purposes, and are made available to astronomers through ESO’s
science archive.

text> Space can be a lonely place. But not so for this quartet of galaxies
making up HCG 86 and observed here with ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope (VST). The
four galaxies located approximately 270 million light years from Earth in the
Sagittarius constellation, are seen from Earth as arranged in triangular shape,
with three of them on a straight line and one underneath; the bright objects to
the right of the elongated galaxy are not part of the quartet. HCG stands for
Hickson Compact Group, and is used to describe groups of four to ten galaxies
where members are physically very close to each other. Because of their
compactness, such groups are ideal environments to study galactic interactions,
which can sometimes lead to galaxies merging with each other. This image of HCG
86 was taken by a team of astronomers led by Rossella Ragusa of the Istituto
Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy as part of the VST Early-type Galaxy Survey
(VEGAS) programme. “With VST we are able to investigate very faint structures in
the galaxies’ outskirts, which are the relics of past gravitational interactions
and merging events,” says Ragusa. In particular, by mapping the light
distribution in and around the group’s galaxies in this study, the team
concluded that these faint structures are the leftovers of satellite galaxies
gobbled by the group approximately seven billion years ago. Located at ESO’s
Paranal Observatory in Chile, the VST is one of the world’s largest survey
telescopes, devoted to mapping the sky in visible light wavelengths. 2021 marks
the anniversary of its first decade of operation, a period during which it has
helped to search for planets outside the Solar System and probe the structure of
our galaxy and the wider Universe.

text> Captured with the MUSE instrument mounted on ESO’s Very Large Telescope
(VLT), this image shows the innermost regions of the distant spiral galaxy NGC
5248, also known as Caldwell 45. Located around 59 million light-years away from
Earth, in the constellation of Boötes, this galaxy is notable for having not one
but two rings around its centre. These rings are characterised by “hot spots” of
starburst activity. Starburst regions, seen as an orange glow in the picture,
are where stars form much more frequently than usual. MUSE, which stands for
Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, is attached to Yepun, one of the four
8.2-metre telescopes that make up the VLT. MUSE decomposes the light of every
single pixel within its field of view into its constituent colours or
wavelengths. This allows researchers to map complex mechanisms within extended
objects, such as analysing the formation of stars in galaxies.

text> The image shows a pair of overlapping spiral galaxies, NGC 3314a and b, in
the top left, caught in a majestic cosmic dance — captured by ESO’s VLT Survey
Telescope (VST). But don’t let the perspective fool you! They are, in fact, not
interacting at all. The two galaxies, located between 117 and 140 million
light-years away in the constellation of Hydra, are actually physically
unrelated and only appear to overlap when viewed from Earth. This unique
alignment gives astronomers the opportunity to measure many properties of the
galaxies, such as how dust absorbs starlight, and hence gain insight into their
composition and evolution. There is another hidden secret in this picture if you
look closely at the lower right region: beyond this stunning cosmic dance you
will find a faint yellowish smudge, the signature of an ultra-diffuse galaxy
(UDG). UDGs are objects as large as the Milky Way but with 100 – 1000 times
fewer stars. These galaxies are extremely faint and lack star-forming gas, which
makes them appear almost like a smudge in the night sky. This UDG, named UDG 32,
is one of the faintest and most spread out galaxies in the Hydra I cluster. This
image was taken as part of a much larger project, the VST Early-type Galaxy
Survey (VEGAS), whose goal is to investigate very faint structures in galaxy
clusters — large groups of galaxies held together by gravity. The study, led by
Enrichetta Iodice from the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy, suggests
that UDG 32 may have formed out of the filaments stemming from NGC 3314a, but
more observations are needed to confirm this.

text> Just as people at a busy crossroad may accidentally bump into each other,
so too can galaxies in the Universe! But in this case, the outcome is more
dramatic than a small nudge. When two galaxies clash, they merge into each
other, giving birth to a new, bigger one. One example is the NGC 7727 galaxy,
shown in this image from ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope (VST) in Chile. Located 89
million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius, NGC 7727 is
believed to be the result of a clash between two galaxies that occurred about
one billion years ago. The consequences of this tremendous cosmic bump are still
evident in the peculiar, irregular shape of NGC 7727 and the streams of stars in
its outer regions. The image was taken in visible light as part of the VST-ATLAS
survey. The goal of the survey is to map a vast region of the Southern Sky — so
large you could fit about 19,000 full moons in it! By studying the galaxies in
this region, astronomers aim to shed new light on the nature of dark energy, the
mysterious force permeating the Universe and causing its accelerating expansion.
