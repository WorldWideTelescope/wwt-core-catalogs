bright nuclear region of the galaxy glows prominently due to a burst of star
formation that is estimated to have begun about 20 million years ago in the
galaxy's time frame.

nearly perfect ring about 150 light years in diameter surrounding a cloud of gas
enriched in oxygen and shock heated to millions of degrees Celsius. The ring
marks the outer limits of a shock wave produced as material ejected in the
supernova explosion plows into the interstellar gas. The size of the ring
indicates that we see the supernova remnant as it was about 10,000 years after
its progenitor star exploded.

text> NASA's three Great Observatories — the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer
Space Telescope, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory — joined forces to probe the
expanding remains of a supernova. Now known as Kepler's supernova remnant, this
object was first seen 400 years ago by sky watchers, including famous astronomer
Johannes Kepler.

text> On January 9, 2008, NASA's Swift satellite was used to fortuitously
observe a very bright X-ray outburst in the spiral galaxy NGC 2770, located 90
million light-years from Earth. In a Nature paper, astronomers show that the
properties of the X-ray outburst are consistent with a shock wave bursting
through the surface of a massive star that has just collapsed, the first time
such an event has been seen. This outburst marked the very early stages of a
supernova explosion called SN 2008D.

text> A dramatic new Chandra image of the nearby galaxy Centaurus A provides one
of the best views to date of the effects of an active supermassive black hole.
Opposing jets of high-energy particles can be seen extending to the outer
reaches of the galaxy, and numerous smaller black holes in binary star systems
are also visible.

text> The most recent supernova in our Galaxy has been discovered by determining
the age of the supernova remnant known as G1.9+0.3. To determine the age,
astronomers tracked how quickly it is expanding, by comparing a radio image from
1985 to a Chandra image taken in 2007. The expansion rate was confirmed with
another radio observation with the VLA in 2008. The difference in size between
these images gives clear evidence for expansion, allowing the age of the remnant
and the time since the original supernova explosion (about 140 years) to be
estimated.
