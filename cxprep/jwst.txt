text> The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has begun the study of one of
the most renowned supernovae, SN 1987A (Supernova 1987A). Located 168,000
light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, SN 1987A has been a target of
intense observations at wavelengths ranging from gamma rays to radio for nearly
40 years, since its discovery in February of 1987. New observations by Webb’s
NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) provide a crucial clue to our understanding of how
a supernova develops over time to shape its remnant.

text> Featured in this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope is
Herbig-Haro 211 (HH 211), a bipolar jet travelling through interstellar space at
supersonic speeds. At roughly 1,000 light-years away from Earth in the
constellation Perseus, the object is one of the youngest and nearest
protostellar outflows, making it an ideal target for Webb. Herbig-Haro objects
are luminous regions surrounding newborn stars, and are formed when stellar
winds or jets of gas spewing from these newborn stars form shockwaves colliding
with nearby gas and dust at high speeds. This spectacular image of HH 211
reveals an outflow from a Class 0 protostar, an infantile analogue of our Sun
when it was no more than a few tens of thousands of years old and with a mass
only 8% of the present-day Sun (it will eventually grow into a star like the
Sun). Infrared imaging is powerful in studying newborn stars and their outflows,
because such stars are invariably still embedded within the gas from the
molecular cloud in which they formed. The infrared emission of the star’s
outflows penetrates the obscuring gas and dust, making a Herbig-Haro object like
HH 211 ideal for observation with Webb’s sensitive infrared instruments.
Molecules excited by the turbulent conditions, including molecular hydrogen,
carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide, emit infrared light that Webb can collect
to map out the structure of the outflows. The image showcases a series of bow
shocks to the southeast (lower-left) and northwest (upper-right) as well as the
narrow bipolar jet that powers them in unprecedented detail — roughly 5 to 10
times higher spatial resolution than any previous images of HH 211. The inner
jet is seen to “wiggle” with mirror symmetry on either side of the central
protostar. This is in agreement with observations on smaller scales and suggests
that the protostar may in fact be an unresolved binary star. [Image description:
At the centre is a thin horizontal multi-coloured cloud tilted from bottom left
to top right. At its centre is a dark brown cloud from which both outflows are
spewing from. These outflows transition from colours of yellow/orange, to a
light blue region, with prominent light pink features in the outer regions.]

text> This new infrared image of NGC 346 from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) traces emission from cool gas and
dust. In this image blue represents silicates and sooty chemical molecules known
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. More diffuse red emission shines
from warm dust heated by the brightest and most massive stars in the heart of
the region. Bright patches and filaments mark areas with abundant numbers of
protostars. This image includes 7.7-micron light shown in blue, 10 microns in
cyan, 11.3 microns in green, 15 microns in yellow, and 21 microns in red (770W,
1000W, 1130W, 1500W, and 2100W filters, respectively). [Image description: The
lower half of this image contains arcs of bluish material that form a boat-like
shape. One end of these arcs points to the top right of the image, while the
other end points toward the bottom left. Another plume of blue filaments expands
from the centre to the top left, resembling the mast of a sailboat. Within and
extending beyond the boat shape are translucent curtains of pink, which cover
most of the image. Stars are noticeably scarce. A couple dozen bright pink
patches with six short diffraction spikes are scattered within the blue
filaments. Many faint blue dots, or stars, also speckle the background, which is
black or dark grey.]

text> This image shows the irregular galaxy NGC 6822, as observed by the
Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) mounted on the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope. NIRCam probes the near-infrared, which in this case makes it suitable
for observing the densely packed star field. Webb’s near-infrared NIRCam image
shows the galaxy’s countless stars in incredible detail. Here, the dust and gas
that pervade the galaxy are reduced to translucent red wisps, laying the stars
bare for astronomical study. The power of Webb’s ice-cold infrared instruments
and the incredible resolution of its primary mirror is necessary to examine
stars hidden in dusty environments, and the results as shown here are
spectacular. The brightest stars appear in pale blue and cyan colours in this
image, colours which are assigned to the shortest wavelengths of light that
NIRCam can detect: red and nearest infrared. The amount of light emitted by any
star decreases at longer and longer wavelengths, towards the mid-infrared, so
the stars that are more faint to NIRCam also appear more warmly coloured here. A
bright blue orb to the lower left of the gas is particularly prominent: this is
a globular cluster, packed with stars. A composite image of NGC 6822 featuring
data from both NIRCam and Webb’s Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) was published
for the ESA/Webb Picture of the Month series in July 2023. [Image Description: A
huge, dense field completely filled with tiny stars. A few of the star images
are a bit larger than the rest, with visible diffraction spikes; two foreground
stars are large and bright on the right side. Many small galaxies within various
shapes and sizes can be seen hiding behind the stars. In the centre some faint,
wispy, dark red gas appears.] or [Image Description: A huge, dense field
