text> An international team of scientists have used data collected by the
NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope to detect a molecule known as the methyl
cation (CH3+) for the first time, located in the protoplanetary disc surrounding
a young star. They accomplished this feat with a cross-disciplinary expert
analysis, including key input from laboratory spectroscopists. The vital role of
CH3+ in interstellar carbon chemistry has been predicted since the 1970s, but
Webb’s unique capabilities have finally made observing it possible — in a region
of space where planets capable of accommodating life could eventually form. This
image is NIRCam’s view of the Orion Bar region studied by the team of
astronomers. Bathed in harsh ultraviolet light from the stars of the Trapezium
Cluster, it is an area of intense activity, with star formation and active
astrochemistry. This made it a perfect place to study the exact impact that
ultraviolet radiation has on the molecular makeup of the discs of gas and dust
that surround new stars. The radiation erodes the nebula’s gas and dust in a
process known as photoevaporation; this creates the rich tapestry of cavities
and filaments that fill the view. The radiation also ionises the molecules,
causing them to emit light — not only does this create a beautiful vista, it
also allows astronomers to study the molecules using the spectrum of their
emitted light obtained with Webb’s MIRI and NIRSpec instruments. The two very
large, bright stars are two of the three stars in the θ² Orionis system — the
Trapezium Cluster is also known as θ¹ Orionis. The brightest star here, θ²
Orionis A, is surrounded by particularly bright and red puffs of dust, which are
reflecting the star’s light towards Earth. Its great brightness — it is visible
with the naked eye — is due to the fact that θ² Orionis A is itself a ternary
system made of three closely bound bright stars. There are more proplyds visible
in this image than just d203-506 — the Orion Nebula is replete with such new
stars. In the very top left, a tiny star is visible within a long, dusty cocoon.
This globule has formed from the star’s protoplanetary disc, as the disc is
broken down by the energetic radiation of the Trapezium Cluster. Around the
globule, a round shockwave is strikingly visible moving through the gas of the
Orion Nebula. [Image description: A nebula made of many layers of cloudy,
colourful material. The top-left side of the image is brightly lit, filled with
wispy, thin material in pale shades of pink and blue. A thick bar of denser,
cloudier material crosses diagonally at the bottom right. It begins as orange
and grows darker and sparser down to the corner. Two very bright stars, with
very long diffraction spikes, lie in this sparse area.]

CH3+ in interstellar carbon chemistry has been predicted since the 1970s, but
Webb’s unique capabilities have finally made observing it possible — in a region
of space where planets capable of accommodating life could eventually form. This
hazy image is Webb’s view of a small region of the Orion Nebula, made with its
MIRI instrument. Filled with gas and dust, the Orion Nebula is a rich
star-forming region. The newborn and young stars emit harsh ultraviolet
radiation that ionises the nebula, causing it to emit light at infrared
wavelengths. MIRI is sensitive to long-wavelength, mid-infrared emission,
highlighting the layers of hot gases on each side of the Orion Bar that
stretches through the centre. The area captured here by MIRI is much smaller
than the NIRCam view, but contains a remarkable amount of detail, thanks to
MIRI’s unprecedented sensitivity at these longer wavelengths. This zoomed-in
MIRI view of the Orion Bar contains the young star-protoplanetary disc system,
named d203-506, that the team of astronomers scoured for key organic molecules.
MIRI’s contribution to the view of d203-506 was critical to obtaining the widest
range of spectra of the system, necessary to confirm their detection of the
methyl cation. In particular, the molecule has a strong spectral line at around
7 microns, a wavelength that is impossible to detect through Earth’s atmosphere,
but with MIRI’s in-built spectroscopy the team was able to unambiguously confirm
the methyl cation’s presence. This version of the MIRI image has been scaled up,
to match the scale of the larger NIRCam image. You can find the image in its
original scale here. [Image description: A nebula made of many layers of cloudy,
colourful material. In the top-left the nebula is coloured in greens, reds and
yellows with a webbed, filament structure, two small stars and a darker gap
region. A wall of thick, cloudy material crosses diagonally, extending towards

gaps in the bottom corner. The image is hazy and unfocused.]

text> This image was stitched together from multiple images captured by the
NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope in near-infrared light. To the right of
centre is a clump of bright white spiral galaxies that seem to be twisting into
one another. Threaded throughout the scene are light pink spirals that look like
pinwheels twirling in the wind. The bright foreground stars, set off in blue,
announce themselves with Webb’s prominent eight-pointed diffraction spikes. In
the bottom row, find the square second from far right. At its right edge, a
misshapen blue galaxy is outfitted in blue-and-pink sparkling star clusters.
There is so much detail to explore in this panoramic vista, known as the Cosmic
Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. The galaxies that first caught
the eyes of the researchers are those that haven’t appeared in any other images
– Webb was the first to reveal their presence. To find them, seek the tiniest,
reddest dots speckled throughout this survey. The light from some of them has
travelled for over 13 billion years to reach the telescope. The team followed up
to obtain spectra with Webb, which led to the discovery of the most distant
active supermassive black hole currently known, along with two more extremely
distant active supermassive black holes that existed when the Universe was only
1 billion years old. The additional studies also confirmed that eleven galaxies
existed when the universe was only 470 to 675 million years old. Webb spent
under an hour capturing each image in this field. Combined, they show off about
100,000 galaxies. The CEERS Survey has already proven to researchers that Webb
will help us learn an incredible amount about the early Universe. [Image

the black background of space. There are many overlapping objects at various
distances. They include large, blue foreground stars, some with eight
diffraction spikes, and white and pink spiral and elliptical galaxies. Numerous

text> Galaxies are not scattered randomly across the universe. They gather
together not only into clusters, but into vast interconnected filamentary
structures with gigantic barren voids in between. This “cosmic web” started out
tenuous and became more distinct over time as gravity drew matter together.
Astronomers for the ASPIRE program using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope have discovered a thread-like arrangement of 10 galaxies that existed
just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This deep galaxy field from Webb’s
NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) hosts these 10 distant galaxies. This 3 million
light-year-long filament is anchored by a very distant and luminous quasar – a
galaxy with an active, supermassive black hole at its core. The quasar, called
J0305-3150, on the right side of the image, outshines its host galaxy. These 10
galaxies existed just 830 million years after the big bang. The team believes
the filament will eventually evolve into a massive cluster of galaxies. These
results were published in two papers in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on 29
June 2023.[Image description: Hundreds of tiny galaxies appear across the black
expanse of space. The galaxy colours vary. Most galaxies are so distant they
appear as single points of light.]

text> The peculiar galaxy NGC 3256 dominates this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA
James Webb Space Telescope. This Milky Way-sized galaxy lies about 120 million
light-years away in the constellation Vela, and is a denizen of the
Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster. NGC 3256 may seem peaceful, a swirl of tightly
entwined spiral arms set in a hazy cloud of light, but this image shows the
aftermath of an ancient cosmic clash. This distorted galaxy is the wreckage of a
head-on collision between two equally massive spiral galaxies which astronomers
estimate to have met around 500 million years ago. The tumultuous past of NGC
3256 is captured in the long tendrils of shining dust and stars which extend
outwards from the main body of the galaxy. The striking red and orange regions
spread across the galaxy contain young stars created in the merger that are
irradiating small dust grains, which then emit infrared light that is captured
in astonishing detail by Webb’s instruments. Further out, there are extended
tidal features, which are mostly stars pulled out of the galaxies when they
collided. If you were asked to picture a galaxy collision, you might picture
stars careening into one another with catastrophically explosive results. In
reality, the spaces between the stars in a galaxy are vast; when galaxies
collide, their clouds of stars pass through one another and mingle like two
clouds of smoke. The gas and dust in colliding galaxies does interact, however,
and with spectacular results. The galactic collision that created NGC 3256
triggered a luminous burst of star formation that can be seen in the brightest
portions of this image. These infant stars shine most brightly at infrared
wavelengths, light which can penetrate through obscuring dust in the galaxy, and
which makes the stars perfect subjects for Webb. This observation is one of
several which take a detailed look at the physics of star formation and black
hole growth in nearby merging galaxies, hoping to transform astronomers'
understanding of galactic evolution. Capturing a selection of luminous infrared
galaxies like NGC 3256 will help the astronomical community to understand how
Webb can unravel the complex histories of nearby star-forming galaxies. This
image contains data from Webb’s Near-InfraRed Camera and Mid-InfraRed
Instrument, which — as the names suggest — capture NGC 3256 in stunning detail
at infrared wavelengths. Previous observations of NGC 3256 with the NASA/ESA
Hubble Space Telescope revealed this cosmic collision at visible wavelengths,
and Hubble and Webb observations are shown side-by-side using the slider tool
here. [Image Description: A large, face-on spiral galaxy. The core is radiating
very brightly. Streaks of dust glow intensely red, in the centre and across most

stars. The halo stretches out into a tidal tail at the upper-left, and another
at the bottom. Small stars and galaxies surround the spiral galaxy, on a black

text> The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has captured a high-resolution
image of a tightly bound pair of actively forming stars, known as Herbig-Haro
46/47, in near-infrared light. Look for them at the centre of the red
diffraction spikes. The stars are buried deeply, appearing as an orange-white
splotch. They are surrounded by a disc of gas and dust that continues to add to
their mass. Herbig-Haro 46/47 is an important object to study because it is
relatively young — only a few thousand years old. Stars take millions of years
to form. Targets like this also give researchers insight into how stars gather
mass over time, potentially allowing them to model how our own Sun, a low-mass
star, formed. The two-sided orange lobes were created by earlier ejections from
these stars. The stars’ more recent ejections appear as blue, thread-like
features, running along the angled diffraction spike that covers the orange
lobes. Actively forming stars ingest the gas and dust that immediately surrounds
them in a disc (imagine an edge-on circle encasing them). When the stars ‘eat’
too much material in too short a time, they respond by sending out two-sided
jets along the opposite axis, settling down the star’s spin, and removing mass
from the area. Over millennia, these ejections regulate how much mass the stars
retain. Don’t miss the delicate, semi-transparent blue cloud. This is a region
of dense dust and gas, known as a nebula. Webb’s crisp near-infrared image lets
us see through its gauzy layers, showing off a lot more of Herbig-Haro 46/47,
while also revealing a wide range of stars and galaxies that lie far beyond it.
The nebula’s edges transform into a soft orange outline, like a backward L along
the right and bottom of the image. The blue nebula influences the shapes of the
orange jets shot out by the central stars. As ejected material rams into the
nebula on the lower left, it takes on wider shapes, because there is more
opportunity for the jets to interact with molecules within the nebula. Its
material also causes the stars’ ejections to light up. Over millions of years
the stars in Herbig-Haro 46/47 will form fully — clearing the scene. Take a
moment to linger on the background. A profusion of extremely distant galaxies
dot Webb’s view. Its composite NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) image is made up of
several exposures, highlighting distant galaxies and stars. Blue objects with
diffraction spikes are stars, and the closer they are, the larger they appear.
White-and-pink spiral galaxies sometimes appear larger than these stars, but are
significantly farther away. The tiniest red dots, Webb’s infrared specialty, are
often the oldest, most distant galaxies. [Image description: At the centre is a
thin horizontal orange cloud tilted from bottom left to top right. It takes up
about two-thirds of the length of this angle, but is thin at the opposite angle.
At its centre is a set of very large red and pink diffraction spikes in Webb’s
familiar eight-pointed pattern. It has a central yellow-white blob, which hides
two tightly orbiting stars. The background is filled with stars and galaxies.]

The infrared image, taken by the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope,
displays a variety of unusual, distorted background galaxies that were only
hinted at in previous NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope images. El Gordo is a
cluster of hundreds of galaxies that existed when the universe was 6.2 billion
years old, making it a “cosmic teenager.” It’s the most massive cluster known to
exist at that time. (“El Gordo” is Spanish for the “Fat One.”) El Gordo acts as
a gravitational lens, distorting and magnifying the light from distant
background galaxies. Two of the most prominent features in the image include the
Thin One, located just below and left of the image center, and the Fishhook, a
red swoosh at upper right. Both are lensed background galaxies. [Image

text> This image shows the irregular galaxy NGC 6822, which was observed by the
Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) mounted on the
NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. As their names suggest, NIRCam and MIRI
probe different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This allows the
instruments to observe different components of the same galaxy, with MIRI
especially sensitive to its gas-rich regions (the yellow swirls in this image)
and NIRCam suitable for observing its densely packed field of stars. NGC 6822
lies about 1.5 million light-years away, and is the Milky Way’s nearest galactic
neighbour that is not one of its satellites. It has a low metallicity, meaning
that it contains low proportions of elements that are not hydrogen and helium.
Metallicity is an absolutely key concept in astronomy, in part because elements
other than hydrogen and helium are largely produced by stars over their
lifetimes. Therefore, in the very early Universe (before the first generation of
stars had been born, lived and died) everything had very low metallicity. This
makes contemporary low-metallicity objects (like NGC 6822) objects of interest
for understanding how processes such as the evolution of stars and the life
cycle of interstellar dust likely occurred in the early Universe. This was the
motivation for these observations of NGC 6822 with Webb: to better understand
how stars form and how dust evolves in low-metallicity environments. The study
of NGC 6822 has an interesting history that long predates modern investigations
with Webb. It was first discovered by E. E. Barnard, who presented his discovery
in a very brief paper in 1884 in The Sidereal Messenger: a short-lived but
important American monthly astronomical journal that was published between 1882
and 1891. As with many astronomical objects that appeared diffuse with
telescopes of the time, NGC 6822 was miscategorised as an “exceedingly faint
nebula”. Over the next few years, a series of confusions arose around NGC 6822
over its apparent size, brightness, and even what kind of object it was, because
astronomers at the time did not properly account for how different the same
object might look with different telescopes. Edwin Hubble, namesake of the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space telescope, went on to study NGC 6822 in depth and
published a far more detailed paper of his own in 1925. This work was
exceptionally important for humanity’s evolving understanding of the Universe,
because, in Hubble’s own words: “N.G.C. 6822, [was] the first object definitely
assigned to a region outside the galactic system”. This paper contributed to
solving the debate that was raging amongst astronomers about the extent of the
Universe at the time by demonstrating that there were astronomical objects that
lay beyond the Milky Way. The study of this galaxy was notably continued by
Susan Kayser, who was the first woman to receive a PhD in astronomy from
Caltech. Her 1966 thesis remained the most thorough investigation of this galaxy
until the 2000s. Now, the study of this key local galaxy is being continued by
Webb. [Image Description: A dense field of stars with clouds of gas and dust
billowing across it. The clouds are patchy and wispy, dense and glowing parts
obscuring the centre of the image. Bright galaxies with various shapes and sizes
shine through the gas and stars. Some of the star images are a bit larger than
the rest, with visible diffraction spikes; two foreground stars are bright in

text> The graceful winding arms of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 stretch
across this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. Unlike the
menagerie of weird and wonderful spiral galaxies with ragged or disrupted spiral
arms, grand-design spiral galaxies boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms
like the ones showcased in this image. This galactic portrait is a composite
image that integrates data from Webb’s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) and
Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI).In this image the dark red regions trace the
filamentary warm dust permeating the medium of the galaxy. The red regions show
the reprocessed light from complex molecules forming on dust grains, while
colours of orange and yellow reveal the regions of ionised gas by the recently
formed star clusters. Stellar feedback has a dramatic effect on the medium of
the galaxy and create complex network of bright knots as well as cavernous black
bubbles. M51 — also known as NGC 5194 — lies about 27 million light-years away
from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici, and is trapped in a tumultuous
relationship with its near neighbour, the dwarf galaxy NGC 5195. The interaction
between these two galaxies has made these galactic neighbours one of the
better-studied galaxy pairs in the night sky. The gravitational influence of
M51’s smaller companion is thought to be partially responsible for the stately
nature of the galaxy’s prominent and distinct spiral arms. If you would like to
learn more about this squabbling pair of galactic neighbours, you can explore
earlier observations of M51 by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope here. This
Webb observation of M51 is one of a series of observations collectively titled
Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers, or FEAST. The FEAST
observations were designed to shed light on the interplay between stellar
feedback and star formation in environments outside of our own galaxy, the Milky
Way. Stellar feedback is the term used to describe the outpouring of energy from
stars into the environments which form them, and is a crucial process in
determining the rates at which stars form. Understanding stellar feedback is
vital to building accurate universal models of star formation. The aim of the
FEAST observations is to discover and study stellar nurseries in galaxies beyond
our own Milky Way. Before Webb became operative, other observatories such as the
Atacama Large Millimetre Array in the Chilean desert and Hubble have given us a
glimpse of star formation either at the onset (tracing the dense gas and dust
clouds where stars will form) or after the stars have destroyed with their
energy their natal gas and dust clouds. Webb is opening a new window into the
early stages of star formation and stellar light, as well as the energy
reprocessing of gas and dust. Scientists are seeing star clusters emerging from
their natal cloud in galaxies beyond our local group for the first time. They
will also be able to measure how long it takes for these stars to pollute with

text> The graceful winding arms of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 stretch
across this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. Unlike the
menagerie of weird and wonderful spiral galaxies with ragged or disrupted spiral
arms, grand-design spiral galaxies boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms
like the ones showcased in this image. This galactic portrait was captured by
Webb’s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). In this image, the dark red features trace
the filamentary warm dust, while colours of red, orange, and yellow show the
sign spots of ionised gas by the recently formed star clusters. Stellar feedback
has a dramatic effect on the medium of the galaxy and create complex network of
bright knots as well as cavernous black bubbles. M51 — also known as NGC 5194 —
lies about 27 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Canes
Venatici, and is trapped in a tumultuous relationship with its near neighbour,
the dwarf galaxy NGC 5195. The interaction between these two galaxies has made
these galactic neighbours one of the better-studied galaxy pairs in the night
sky. The gravitational influence of M51’s smaller companion is thought to be
partially responsible for the stately nature of the galaxy’s prominent and
distinct spiral arms. If you would like to learn more about this squabbling pair
of galactic neighbours, you can explore earlier observations of M51 by the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope here. This Webb observation of M51 is one of a
series of observations collectively titled Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic
Star clusTers, or FEAST. The FEAST observations were designed to shed light on
the interplay between stellar feedback and star formation in environments
outside of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Stellar feedback is the term used to
describe the outpouring of energy from stars into the environments which form
them, and is a crucial process in determining the rates at which stars form.
Understanding stellar feedback is vital to building accurate universal models of
star formation. The aim of the FEAST observations is to discover and study
stellar nurseries in galaxies beyond our own Milky Way. Before Webb became
operative, other observatories such as the Atacama Large Millimetre Array in the
Chilean desert and Hubble have given us a glimpse of star formation either at
the onset (tracing the dense gas and dust clouds where stars will form) or after
the stars have destroyed with their energy their natal gas and dust clouds. Webb
is opening a new window into the early stages of star formation and stellar
light, as well as the energy reprocessing of gas and dust. Scientists are seeing
star clusters emerging from their natal cloud in galaxies beyond our local group
for the first time. They will also be able to measure how long it takes for
these stars to pollute with newly formed metals and to clean out the gas (these
time scales are different from galaxy to galaxy). By studying these processes,
we will better understand how the star formation cycle and metal enrichment are
regulated within galaxies as well as what are the time scales for planets and

text> This image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope of a massive
galaxy cluster called WHL0137-08 contains the most strongly magnified galaxy
known in the Universe’s first billion years: the Sunrise Arc, and within that
galaxy, the most distant star ever detected. The star, nicknamed Earendel, was
first discovered by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Follow-up observations
using Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) reveals the star to be a massive
B-type star more than twice as hot as our Sun, and about a million times more
luminous. Earendel is positioned along a ripple in spacetime that gives it
extreme magnification, allowing it to emerge into view from its host galaxy,
which appears as a red smear across the sky. The star is detectable only due to
the combined power of human technology and nature via an effect called
gravitational lensing. While other features in the galaxy appear multiple times
due to the gravitational lensing, Earendel only appears as a single point of
light even in Webb’s high-resolution infrared imaging. Based on this,
astronomers determine the star is magnified by a factor of at least 4000, and
thus Earendel is extremely small – the most distant stellar source ever
detected. The previous record-holder for the most distant star was detected by
Hubble around 4 billion years after the Big Bang. In this image, the Sunrise Arc
appears just below the diffraction spike at the 5 o’clock position. The fuzzier,
white galaxies at the centre of the image are part of the galaxy cluster bound
together by gravity. The various redder, curved galaxies are background galaxies
picked up by Webb’s sensitive mirror. Webb’s NIRCam also shows other remarkable
details in the Sunrise Arc. Features include both young star-forming regions and
older established star clusters. On either side of the wrinkle of maximum
magnification, which runs right through Earendel, these features are mirrored by
the distortion of the gravitational lens. The region forming stars appears
elongated, and is estimated to be less than 5 million years old. Smaller dots on
either side of Earendel are two images of one older, more established star
cluster, estimated to be 10 million years or older. Astronomers determined this
star cluster is gravitationally bound and likely to persist until the present
day. This shows us how the globular clusters in our own Milky Way might have
looked when they formed 13 billion years ago. Astronomers are currently
analysing data from Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument
observations of the Sunrise Arc galaxy and Earendel, which will provide precise
composition and distance measurements for the galaxy. Since Hubble’s discovery
of Earendel, Webb has detected other very distant stars using this technique,
though none quite as far as Earendel. The discoveries have opened a new realm of
the Universe to stellar physics, and new subject matter to scientists studying
the early Universe, where once galaxies were the smallest detectable cosmic
objects. There is cautious hope that this could be a step toward the eventual
detection of one of the very first generation of stars, composed only of the raw
ingredients of the Universe created in the big bang – hydrogen and helium.
[Image description: A black background is scattered with hundreds of small
galaxies of different shapes, ranging in colour from white to yellow to red.
Some galaxies, mostly the redder galaxies, are distorted, appearing to be
stretched out or mirror imaged. Just a little bit above the centre, there is a
bright source of light, a star, with 8 bright diffraction spikes extending out
from it. Below the star are several noticeably fuzzy white galaxies that
resemble cotton balls – these are part of a galaxy cluster. To the lower right
of the star is a particularly long, red, thin line stretching from one o’clock
to 7 o’clock.]

Ring Nebula with unprecedented detail. Formed by a star throwing off its outer
layers as it runs out of fuel, the Ring Nebula is an archetypal planetary
nebula. Also known as M57 and NGC 6720, it is both relatively close to Earth at
roughly 2,500 light-years away. This new image provides unprecedented spatial
resolution and spectral sensitivity. For example, the intricate details of the
filament structure of the inner ring are particularly visible in this dataset.
There are some 20,000 dense globules in the nebula, which are rich in molecular
hydrogen. In contrast, the inner region shows very hot gas. The main shell
contains a thin ring of enhanced emission fromcarbon-based molecules known as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Roughly ten concentric arcs are located
just beyond the outer edge of the main ring. The arcs are thought to originate
from the interaction of the central star with a low-mass companion orbiting at a
distance comparable to that between the Earth and the dwarf planet Pluto. In
this way, nebulae like the Ring Nebula reveal a kind of astronomical
archaeology, as astronomers study the nebula to learn about the star that
created it. [Image description: This image of the Ring Nebula appears as a

nebulous region surrounding Westerlund 2, a young star cluster in the Milky Way.
Dense pillars of gas and dust, as seen in this image, point towards the central
star cluster. These nebulous areas are thought to house stellar birth! What
appears to be steam coming off of the central pillar is material streaming away
from the nebula as it is being eroded by stellar radiation from nearby stars.
This intense radiation eats away at gas and dust, shaping these pillars and the
surrounding region. Using infrared light, JWST can peer behind some of this gas
and dust to reveal evidence of stellar formation, such as protostellar jets! The
James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionize our understanding of stellar birth
as it continues to study the life of stars. These observations are from Proposal
2640 as part of the General Observer (GO) Program. Image processed by Brittany

are many pillars of gas and dust which are being carved.
This young star-forming region is just a million years old and contains
thousands of new stars spanning a range of masses from 40 down to less than 0.1
times the mass of the Sun. The most massive and hottest stars in the region,
notably the Trapezium in the centre, have sculpted a cavity in the surface of
the giant molecular cloud from which they were born, which can be readily seen

text> The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has begun the study of one of
the most renowned supernovae, SN 1987A (Supernova 1987A). Located 168,000
light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, SN 1987A has been a target of
intense observations at wavelengths ranging from gamma rays to radio for nearly
40 years, since its discovery in February of 1987. New observations by Webb’s
NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) provide a crucial clue to our understanding of how
a supernova develops over time to shape its remnant. This image reveals a
central structure like a keyhole. This center is packed with clumpy gas and dust
ejected by the supernova explosion. The dust is so dense that even near-infrared
light that Webb detects can’t penetrate it, shaping the dark “hole” in the
keyhole. A bright, equatorial ring surrounds the inner keyhole, forming a band
around the waist that connects two faint arms of hourglass-shaped outer rings.
The equatorial ring, formed from material ejected tens of thousands of years
before the supernova explosion, contains bright hot spots, which appeared as the
supernova’s shock wave hit the ring. Now spots are found even exterior to the
ring, with diffuse emission surrounding it. These are the locations of supernova
shocks hitting more exterior material. In this image blue represents light at
1.5 microns (F150W), cyan 1.64 and 2.0 microns (F164N, F200W), yellow 3.23
microns (F323N), orange 4.05 microns (F405N), and red 4.44 microns (F444W).

text> Featured in this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope is
Herbig-Haro 211 (HH 211), a bipolar jet travelling through interstellar space at
supersonic speeds. At roughly 1,000 light-years away from Earth in the
constellation Perseus, the object is one of the youngest and nearest
protostellar outflows, making it an ideal target for Webb. Herbig-Haro objects
are luminous regions surrounding newborn stars, and are formed when stellar
winds or jets of gas spewing from these newborn stars form shockwaves colliding
with nearby gas and dust at high speeds. This spectacular image of HH 211
reveals an outflow from a Class 0 protostar, an infantile analogue of our Sun
when it was no more than a few tens of thousands of years old and with a mass
only 8% of the present-day Sun (it will eventually grow into a star like the
Sun). Infrared imaging is powerful in studying newborn stars and their outflows,
because such stars are invariably still embedded within the gas from the
molecular cloud in which they formed. The infrared emission of the star’s
outflows penetrates the obscuring gas and dust, making a Herbig-Haro object like
HH 211 ideal for observation with Webb’s sensitive infrared instruments.
Molecules excited by the turbulent conditions, including molecular hydrogen,
carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide, emit infrared light that Webb can collect
to map out the structure of the outflows. The image showcases a series of bow
shocks to the southeast (lower-left) and northwest (upper-right) as well as the
narrow bipolar jet that powers them in unprecedented detail — roughly 5 to 10
times higher spatial resolution than any previous images of HH 211. The inner
jet is seen to “wiggle” with mirror symmetry on either side of the central
protostar. This is in agreement with observations on smaller scales and suggests
that the protostar may in fact be an unresolved binary star. [Image description:
At the centre is a thin horizontal multi-coloured cloud tilted from bottom left
to top right. At its centre is a dark brown cloud from which both outflows are
spewing from. These outflows transition from colours of yellow/orange, to a
light blue region, with prominent light pink features in the outer regions.]

text> This new infrared image of NGC 346 from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) traces emission from cool gas and
dust. In this image blue represents silicates and sooty chemical molecules known
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. More diffuse red emission shines
from warm dust heated by the brightest and most massive stars in the heart of
the region. Bright patches and filaments mark areas with abundant numbers of
protostars.  This image includes 7.7-micron light shown in blue, 10 microns in
cyan, 11.3 microns in green, 15 microns in yellow, and 21 microns in red (770W,
1000W, 1130W, 1500W, and 2100W filters, respectively). [Image description: The
lower half of this image contains arcs of bluish material that form a boat-like
shape. One end of these arcs points to the top right of the image, while the
other end points toward the bottom left. Another plume of blue filaments expands
from the centre to the top left, resembling the mast of a sailboat. Within and
extending beyond the boat shape are translucent curtains of pink, which cover
most of the image. Stars are noticeably scarce. A couple dozen bright pink
patches with six short diffraction spikes are scattered within the blue
filaments. Many faint blue dots, or stars, also speckle the background, which is
black or dark grey.]

text> The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has gazed at the Crab Nebula
in the search for answers about the supernova remnant’s origins. Webb’s NIRCam
(Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) have revealed new
details in infrared light. Similar to the Hubble optical wavelength image
released in 2005, with Webb the remnant appears to consist of a crisp, cage-like
structure of fluffy red-orange filaments of gas that trace doubly ionised
sulphur (sulphur III). Within the remnant’s interior, yellow-white and green
fluffy ridges form large-scale loop-like structures, which represent areas where
dust particles reside. The area within is composed of translucent, milky
material. This material is emitting synchrotron radiation, which is emitted
across the electromagnetic spectrum but becomes particularly vibrant thanks to
Webb’s sensitivity and spatial resolution. It is generated by particles
accelerated to extremely high speeds as they wind around magnetic field lines.
The synchrotron radiation can be traced throughout the majority of the Crab
Nebula’s interior. Locate the wisps that follow a ripple-like pattern in the
middle. In the centre of this ring-like structure is a bright white dot: a
rapidly rotating neutron star. Further out from the core, follow the thin white
ribbons of the radiation. The curvy wisps are closely grouped together,
following different directions that mimic the structure of the pulsar’s magnetic
field. Note how certain gas filaments are bluer in colour. These areas contain
singly ionised iron (iron II). [Image description: An oval nebula with a complex
structure against a black background. On the oval’s exterior lie curtains of
glowing red and orange fluffy material. Interior to this outer shell lie
large-scale loops of mottled filaments of yellow-white and green, studded with
clumps and knots. Translucent thin ribbons of smoky white lie within the
remnant’s interior, brightest toward its centre.]

text> This image shows the irregular galaxy NGC 6822, as observed by the
Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) mounted on the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope. NIRCam probes the near-infrared, which in this case makes it suitable
for observing the densely packed star field. Webb’s near-infrared NIRCam image
shows the galaxy’s countless stars in incredible detail. Here, the dust and gas
that pervade the galaxy are reduced to translucent red wisps, laying the stars
bare for astronomical study. The power of Webb’s ice-cold infrared instruments
and the incredible resolution of its primary mirror is necessary to examine
stars hidden in dusty environments, and the results as shown here are
spectacular. The brightest stars appear in pale blue and cyan colours in this
image, colours which are assigned to the shortest wavelengths of light that
NIRCam can detect: red and nearest infrared. The amount of light emitted by any
star decreases at longer and longer wavelengths, towards the mid-infrared, so
the stars that are more faint to NIRCam also appear more warmly coloured here. A
bright blue orb to the lower left of the gas is particularly prominent: this is
a globular cluster, packed with stars. A composite image of NGC 6822 featuring
data from both NIRCam and Webb’s Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) was published
for the ESA/Webb Picture of the Month series in July 2023. [Image Description: A
huge, dense field completely filled with tiny stars. A few of the star images
are a bit larger than the rest, with visible diffraction spikes; two foreground
stars are large and bright on the right side. Many small galaxies within various
shapes and sizes can be seen hiding behind the stars. In the centre some faint,
wispy, dark red gas appears.] or [Image Description: A huge, dense field
