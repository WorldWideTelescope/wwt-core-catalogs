text> A new image of the galaxy cluster known as “El Gordo” is revealing distant
and dusty objects never seen before, and providing a bounty of fresh science.
The infrared image, taken by the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope,
displays a variety of unusual, distorted background galaxies that were only
hinted at in previous NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope images. El Gordo is a
cluster of hundreds of galaxies that existed when the universe was 6.2 billion
years old, making it a “cosmic teenager.” It’s the most massive cluster known to
exist at that time. (“El Gordo” is Spanish for the “Fat One.”) El Gordo acts as
a gravitational lens, distorting and magnifying the light from distant
background galaxies. Two of the most prominent features in the image include the
Thin One, located just below and left of the image center, and the Fishhook, a
red swoosh at upper right. Both are lensed background galaxies. [Image
description : A black background is scattered with hundreds of small galaxies of
different shapes, ranging in color from white to yellow to red. Some galaxies
are distorted, appearing to be stretched out or mirror imaged. Near the center,
a particularly long and thin line stretches from ten o’clock to four o’clock. At
upper right, a red swoosh extends about three-quarters of the way around a pair
of galaxies. A handful of foreground stars display eight diffraction spikes.]

text> This image shows the irregular galaxy NGC 6822, which was observed by the
Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) mounted on the
NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. As their names suggest, NIRCam and MIRI
probe different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This allows the
instruments to observe different components of the same galaxy, with MIRI
especially sensitive to its gas-rich regions (the yellow swirls in this image)
and NIRCam suitable for observing its densely packed field of stars. NGC 6822
lies about 1.5 million light-years away, and is the Milky Way’s nearest galactic
neighbour that is not one of its satellites. It has a low metallicity, meaning
that it contains low proportions of elements that are not hydrogen and helium.
Metallicity is an absolutely key concept in astronomy, in part because elements
other than hydrogen and helium are largely produced by stars over their
lifetimes. Therefore, in the very early Universe (before the first generation of
stars had been born, lived and died) everything had very low metallicity. This
makes contemporary low-metallicity objects (like NGC 6822) objects of interest
for understanding how processes such as the evolution of stars and the life
cycle of interstellar dust likely occurred in the early Universe. This was the
motivation for these observations of NGC 6822 with Webb: to better understand
how stars form and how dust evolves in low-metallicity environments. The study
of NGC 6822 has an interesting history that long predates modern investigations
with Webb. It was first discovered by E. E. Barnard, who presented his discovery
in a very brief paper in 1884 in The Sidereal Messenger: a short-lived but
important American monthly astronomical journal that was published between 1882
and 1891. As with many astronomical objects that appeared diffuse with
telescopes of the time, NGC 6822 was miscategorised as an “exceedingly faint
nebula”. Over the next few years, a series of confusions arose around NGC 6822
over its apparent size, brightness, and even what kind of object it was, because
astronomers at the time did not properly account for how different the same
object might look with different telescopes. Edwin Hubble, namesake of the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space telescope, went on to study NGC 6822 in depth and
published a far more detailed paper of his own in 1925. This work was
exceptionally important for humanity’s evolving understanding of the Universe,
because, in Hubble’s own words: “N.G.C. 6822, [was] the first object definitely
assigned to a region outside the galactic system”. This paper contributed to
solving the debate that was raging amongst astronomers about the extent of the
Universe at the time by demonstrating that there were astronomical objects that
lay beyond the Milky Way. The study of this galaxy was notably continued by
Susan Kayser, who was the first woman to receive a PhD in astronomy from
Caltech. Her 1966 thesis remained the most thorough investigation of this galaxy
until the 2000s. Now, the study of this key local galaxy is being continued by
Webb. [Image Description: A dense field of stars with clouds of gas and dust
billowing across it. The clouds are patchy and wispy, dense and glowing parts
obscuring the centre of the image. Bright galaxies with various shapes and sizes
shine through the gas and stars. Some of the star images are a bit larger than
the rest, with visible diffraction spikes; two foreground stars are bright in
the lower-right corner.] Links Slider tool: NGC 6822 (NIRCam and MIRI images)

text> The graceful winding arms of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 stretch
across this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. Unlike the
menagerie of weird and wonderful spiral galaxies with ragged or disrupted spiral
arms, grand-design spiral galaxies boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms
like the ones showcased in this image. This galactic portrait is a composite
image that integrates data from Webb’s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) and
Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI).In this image the dark red regions trace the
filamentary warm dust permeating the medium of the galaxy. The red regions show
the reprocessed light from complex molecules forming on dust grains, while
colours of orange and yellow reveal the regions of ionised gas by the recently
formed star clusters. Stellar feedback has a dramatic effect on the medium of
the galaxy and create complex network of bright knots as well as cavernous black
bubbles. M51 — also known as NGC 5194 — lies about 27 million light-years away
from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici, and is trapped in a tumultuous
relationship with its near neighbour, the dwarf galaxy NGC 5195. The interaction
between these two galaxies has made these galactic neighbours one of the
better-studied galaxy pairs in the night sky. The gravitational influence of
M51’s smaller companion is thought to be partially responsible for the stately
nature of the galaxy’s prominent and distinct spiral arms. If you would like to
learn more about this squabbling pair of galactic neighbours, you can explore
earlier observations of M51 by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope here. This
Webb observation of M51 is one of a series of observations collectively titled
Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers, or FEAST. The FEAST
observations were designed to shed light on the interplay between stellar
feedback and star formation in environments outside of our own galaxy, the Milky
Way. Stellar feedback is the term used to describe the outpouring of energy from
stars into the environments which form them, and is a crucial process in
determining the rates at which stars form. Understanding stellar feedback is
vital to building accurate universal models of star formation. The aim of the
FEAST observations is to discover and study stellar nurseries in galaxies beyond
our own Milky Way. Before Webb became operative, other observatories such as the
Atacama Large Millimetre Array in the Chilean desert and Hubble have given us a
glimpse of star formation either at the onset (tracing the dense gas and dust
clouds where stars will form) or after the stars have destroyed with their
energy their natal gas and dust clouds. Webb is opening a new window into the
early stages of star formation and stellar light, as well as the energy
reprocessing of gas and dust. Scientists are seeing star clusters emerging from
their natal cloud in galaxies beyond our local group for the first time. They
will also be able to measure how long it takes for these stars to pollute with
newly formed metals and to clean out the gas (these time scales are different
from galaxy to galaxy). By studying these processes, we will better understand
how the star formation cycle and metal enrichment are regulated within galaxies
as well as what are the time scales for planets and brown dwarfs to form. Once
dust and gas is removed from the newly formed stars, there is no material left
to form planets. [Image Description: A large spiral galaxy takes up the entirety
of the image. The core is mostly bright white, but there are also swirling,
detailed structures that resemble water circling a drain. There is white and
pale blue light that emanates from stars and dust at the core’s centre, but it
is tightly limited to the core. The rings feature colours of deep red and orange
and highlight filaments of dust around cavernous black bubbles.] Links M51

text> This image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope of a massive
galaxy cluster called WHL0137-08 contains the most strongly magnified galaxy
known in the Universe’s first billion years: the Sunrise Arc, and within that
galaxy, the most distant star ever detected. The star, nicknamed Earendel, was
first discovered by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Follow-up observations
using Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) reveals the star to be a massive
B-type star more than twice as hot as our Sun, and about a million times more
luminous. Earendel is positioned along a ripple in spacetime that gives it
extreme magnification, allowing it to emerge into view from its host galaxy,
which appears as a red smear across the sky. The star is detectable only due to
the combined power of human technology and nature via an effect called
gravitational lensing. While other features in the galaxy appear multiple times
due to the gravitational lensing, Earendel only appears as a single point of
light even in Webb’s high-resolution infrared imaging. Based on this,
astronomers determine the star is magnified by a factor of at least 4000, and
thus Earendel is extremely small – the most distant stellar source ever
detected. The previous record-holder for the most distant star was detected by
Hubble around 4 billion years after the Big Bang. In this image, the Sunrise Arc
appears just below the diffraction spike at the 5 o’clock position. The fuzzier,
white galaxies at the centre of the image are part of the galaxy cluster bound
together by gravity. The various redder, curved galaxies are background galaxies
picked up by Webb’s sensitive mirror. Webb’s NIRCam also shows other remarkable
details in the Sunrise Arc. Features include both young star-forming regions and
older established star clusters. On either side of the wrinkle of maximum
magnification, which runs right through Earendel, these features are mirrored by
the distortion of the gravitational lens. The region forming stars appears
elongated, and is estimated to be less than 5 million years old. Smaller dots on
either side of Earendel are two images of one older, more established star
cluster, estimated to be 10 million years or older. Astronomers determined this
star cluster is gravitationally bound and likely to persist until the present
day. This shows us how the globular clusters in our own Milky Way might have
looked when they formed 13 billion years ago. Astronomers are currently
analysing data from Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument
observations of the Sunrise Arc galaxy and Earendel, which will provide precise
composition and distance measurements for the galaxy. Since Hubble’s discovery
of Earendel, Webb has detected other very distant stars using this technique,
though none quite as far as Earendel. The discoveries have opened a new realm of
the Universe to stellar physics, and new subject matter to scientists studying
the early Universe, where once galaxies were the smallest detectable cosmic
objects. There is cautious hope that this could be a step toward the eventual
detection of one of the very first generation of stars, composed only of the raw
ingredients of the Universe created in the big bang – hydrogen and helium.
[Image description: A black background is scattered with hundreds of small
galaxies of different shapes, ranging in colour from white to yellow to red.
Some galaxies, mostly the redder galaxies, are distorted, appearing to be
stretched out or mirror imaged. Just a little bit above the centre, there is a
bright source of light, a star, with 8 bright diffraction spikes extending out
from it. Below the star are several noticeably fuzzy white galaxies that
resemble cotton balls – these are part of a galaxy cluster. To the lower right
of the star is a particularly long, red, thin line stretching from one o’clock
to 7 o’clock.]

text> The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observed part of the
nebulous region surrounding Westerlund 2, a young star cluster in the Milky Way.
Dense pillars of gas and dust, as seen in this image, point towards the central
star cluster. These nebulous areas are thought to house stellar birth! What
appears to be steam coming off of the central pillar is material streaming away
from the nebula as it is being eroded by stellar radiation from nearby stars.
This intense radiation eats away at gas and dust, shaping these pillars and the
surrounding region. Using infrared light, JWST can peer behind some of this gas
and dust to reveal evidence of stellar formation, such as protostellar jets! The
James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionize our understanding of stellar birth
as it continues to study the life of stars. These observations are from Proposal
2640 as part of the General Observer (GO) Program. Image processed by Brittany
Kundert.

text> This image shows the full survey of the inner Orion Nebula and Trapezium
Cluster made using the NIRCam instrument on the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope. This is the long-wavelength colour composite, which focuses on the
gas, dust, and molecules in the region with unprecedented sensitivity in the
thermal infrared. The cavity is mostly filled with ionised gas, seen here in
purple, while the surroundings have a mix of dust and molecular gas seen in
reds, browns, and greens. The Bright Bay to the upper left is being eroded by
the massive stars at the centre of the region and there are many pillars of gas
and dust which are being carved. This young star-forming region is just a
million years old and contains thousands of new stars spanning a range of masses
from 40 down to less than 0.1 times the mass of the Sun. The most massive and
hottest stars in the region, notably the Trapezium in the centre, have sculpted
a cavity in the surface of the giant molecular cloud from which they were born,
which can be readily seen in this image. The Orion Nebula lies roughly 1300
light-years from Earth in the so-called 'sword' of the constellation of Orion
the Hunter, and the image shows a region that is 4 by 2.75 light years in size.
Image description: An image of a young star-forming region filled with with
wispy purple, green, and red nebulosity. The purple ionised gas is seen mostly
towards the centre, with browns, greens, and reds behind, while the periphery is
mostly bright green and darker brown to the left. There is a large spray of
yellow, orange, red, and purple towards the top centre, and the nebula fades to
near black to the right. There are thousands of stars sprinkled across the
field, concentrated towards the centre, but they generally appear fainter at
longer wavelengths, with some exceptions. The brightest sources in the field
have extensive diffraction spikes characteristic of Webb.

text> The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has begun the study of one of
the most renowned supernovae, SN 1987A (Supernova 1987A). Located 168,000
light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, SN 1987A has been a target of
intense observations at wavelengths ranging from gamma rays to radio for nearly
40 years, since its discovery in February of 1987. New observations by Webb’s
NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) provide a crucial clue to our understanding of how
a supernova develops over time to shape its remnant. This image reveals a
central structure like a keyhole. This center is packed with clumpy gas and dust
ejected by the supernova explosion. The dust is so dense that even near-infrared
light that Webb detects can’t penetrate it, shaping the dark “hole” in the
keyhole. A bright, equatorial ring surrounds the inner keyhole, forming a band
around the waist that connects two faint arms of hourglass-shaped outer rings.
The equatorial ring, formed from material ejected tens of thousands of years
before the supernova explosion, contains bright hot spots, which appeared as the
supernova’s shock wave hit the ring. Now spots are found even exterior to the
ring, with diffuse emission surrounding it. These are the locations of supernova
shocks hitting more exterior material. In this image blue represents light at
1.5 microns (F150W), cyan 1.64 and 2.0 microns (F164N, F200W), yellow 3.23
microns (F323N), orange 4.05 microns (F405N), and red 4.44 microns (F444W).

text> Featured in this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope is
Herbig-Haro 211 (HH 211), a bipolar jet travelling through interstellar space at
supersonic speeds. At roughly 1,000 light-years away from Earth in the
constellation Perseus, the object is one of the youngest and nearest
protostellar outflows, making it an ideal target for Webb. Herbig-Haro objects
are luminous regions surrounding newborn stars, and are formed when stellar
winds or jets of gas spewing from these newborn stars form shockwaves colliding
with nearby gas and dust at high speeds. This spectacular image of HH 211
reveals an outflow from a Class 0 protostar, an infantile analogue of our Sun
when it was no more than a few tens of thousands of years old and with a mass
only 8% of the present-day Sun (it will eventually grow into a star like the
Sun). Infrared imaging is powerful in studying newborn stars and their outflows,
because such stars are invariably still embedded within the gas from the
molecular cloud in which they formed. The infrared emission of the star’s
outflows penetrates the obscuring gas and dust, making a Herbig-Haro object like
HH 211 ideal for observation with Webb’s sensitive infrared instruments.
Molecules excited by the turbulent conditions, including molecular hydrogen,
carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide, emit infrared light that Webb can collect
to map out the structure of the outflows. The image showcases a series of bow
shocks to the southeast (lower-left) and northwest (upper-right) as well as the
narrow bipolar jet that powers them in unprecedented detail — roughly 5 to 10
times higher spatial resolution than any previous images of HH 211. The inner
jet is seen to “wiggle” with mirror symmetry on either side of the central
protostar. This is in agreement with observations on smaller scales and suggests
that the protostar may in fact be an unresolved binary star. [Image description:
At the centre is a thin horizontal multi-coloured cloud tilted from bottom left
to top right. At its centre is a dark brown cloud from which both outflows are
spewing from. These outflows transition from colours of yellow/orange, to a
light blue region, with prominent light pink features in the outer regions.]

text> This new infrared image of NGC 346 from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space
Telescope’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) traces emission from cool gas and
dust. In this image blue represents silicates and sooty chemical molecules known
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. More diffuse red emission shines
from warm dust heated by the brightest and most massive stars in the heart of
the region. Bright patches and filaments mark areas with abundant numbers of
protostars. This image includes 7.7-micron light shown in blue, 10 microns in
cyan, 11.3 microns in green, 15 microns in yellow, and 21 microns in red (770W,
1000W, 1130W, 1500W, and 2100W filters, respectively). [Image description: The
lower half of this image contains arcs of bluish material that form a boat-like
shape. One end of these arcs points to the top right of the image, while the
other end points toward the bottom left. Another plume of blue filaments expands
from the centre to the top left, resembling the mast of a sailboat. Within and
extending beyond the boat shape are translucent curtains of pink, which cover
most of the image. Stars are noticeably scarce. A couple dozen bright pink
patches with six short diffraction spikes are scattered within the blue
filaments. Many faint blue dots, or stars, also speckle the background, which is
black or dark grey.]
