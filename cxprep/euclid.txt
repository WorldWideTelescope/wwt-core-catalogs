text> This incredible snapshot from Euclid is a revolution for astronomy. The
image shows 1000 galaxies belonging to the Perseus Cluster, and more than 100
000 additional galaxies further away in the background, each containing up to
hundreds of billions of stars.                                  Many of these
faint galaxies were previously unseen. Some of them are so distant that their
light has taken 10 billion years to reach us. By mapping the distribution and
shapes of these galaxies, cosmologists will be able to find out more about how
dark matter shaped the Universe that we see today.
This is the first time that such a large image has allowed us to capture so many
Perseus galaxies in such a high level of detail. Perseus is one of the most
massive structures known in the Universe, located ‘just’ 240 million light-years
away from Earth, containing thousands of galaxies, immersed in a vast cloud of
hot gas. Astronomers demonstrated that galaxy clusters like Perseus can only
have formed if dark matter is present in the Universe.
[Technical details: The data in this image were taken in just five hours of
observation. This colour image was obtained by combining VIS data and NISP
photometry in Y and H bands; its size is 8800 x 8800 pixels. VIS and NISP enable
observing astronomical sources in four different wavelength ranges. Aesthetics
choices led to the selection of three out of these four bands to be cast onto
the traditional Red-Green-Blue colour channels used to represent images on our
digital screens (RGB). The blue, green, red channels capture the Universe seen
by Euclid around the wavelength 0.7, 1.1, and 1.7 micron respectively. This
gives Euclid a distinctive colour palette: hot stars have a white-blue hue,
excited hydrogen gas appears in the blue channel, and regions rich in dust and
molecular gas have a clear red hue. Distant redshifted background galaxies
appear very red. In the image, the stars have six prominent spikes due to how
light interacts with the optical system of the telescope in the process of
diffraction. Another signature of Euclid special optics is the presence of a
few, very faint and small round regions of a fuzzy blue colour. These are normal
artefacts of complex optical systems, so-called ‘optical ghost’; easily
identifiable during data analysis, they do not cause any problem for the science
goals. ]                                  [Image description: This square
astronomical image shows thousands of galaxies across the black expanse of
space. The closest thousand or so galaxies belong to the Perseus Cluster. The
most prominent members of the cluster are visible in the centre of the image and
appear as large galaxies with haloes around them in yellow/white, comparable to
streetlamps in a foggy night. The background of this image is scattered with a
hundred thousand more distant galaxies of different shapes, ranging in colour
from white to yellow to red. Most galaxies are so far away they appear as single
points of light. The more distant a galaxy is, the redder it appears.]
