text> Euclid shows us a spectacularly panoramic and detailed view of the
Horsehead Nebula, also known as Barnard 33 and part of the constellation Orion.
At approximately 1375 light-years away, the Horsehead – visible as a dark cloud
shaped like a horse’s head – is the closest giant star-forming region to Earth.
It sits just to the south of star Alnitak, the easternmost of Orion’s famous
three-star belt, and is part of the vast Orion molecular cloud.
Many other telescopes have taken images of the Horsehead Nebula, but none of
them are able to create such a sharp and wide view as Euclid can with just one
observation. Euclid captured this image of the Horsehead in about one hour,
which showcases the mission's ability to very quickly image an unprecedented
area of the sky in high detail.                                  [Technical
details: The data in this image were taken in just five hours of observation.
This colour image was obtained by combining VIS data and NISP photometry in Y
and H bands; its size is 8800 x 8800 pixels. VIS and NISP enable observing
astronomical sources in four different wavelength ranges. Aesthetics choices led
to the selection of three out of these four bands to be cast onto the
traditional Red-Green-Blue colour channels used to represent images on our
digital screens (RGB). The blue, green, red channels capture the Universe seen
by Euclid around the wavelength 0.7, 1.1, and 1.7 micron respectively. This
gives Euclid a distinctive colour palette: hot stars have a white-blue hue,
excited hydrogen gas appears in the blue channel, and regions rich in dust and
molecular gas have a clear red hue. Distant redshifted background galaxies
appear very red. In the image, the stars have six prominent spikes due to how
light interacts with the optical system of the telescope in the process of
diffraction. Another signature of Euclid special optics is the presence of a
few, very faint and small round regions of a fuzzy blue colour. These are normal
artefacts of complex optical systems, so-called ‘optical ghost’; easily
identifiable during data analysis, they do not cause any problem for the science
goals. ]                                  [Image description: This square
astronomical image is divided horizontally by a waving line between a
white-orange cloudscape forming a nebula along the bottom portion and a
comparatively blue-purple-pink upper portion. From the nebula in the bottom half
of the image, an orange cloud shaped like a horsehead sticks out. In the bottom
left of the image, a white round glow is visible. The clouds from the bottom
half of the image shine purple/blue light into the upper half. The top of the
image shows the black expanse of space. Speckled across both portions is a
starfield, showing stars of varying sizes and colours. Blue stars are younger
and red stars are older.]
