description> This square astronomical image shows thousands of galaxies across
the black expanse of space. The closest thousand or so galaxies belong to the
Perseus Cluster. The most prominent members of the cluster are visible in the
centre of the image and appear as large galaxies with haloes around them in
yellow/white, comparable to streetlamps in a foggy night. The background of this
image is scattered with a hundred thousand more distant galaxies of different
shapes, ranging in colour from white to yellow to red. Most galaxies are so far
away they appear as single points of light. The more distant a galaxy is, the
redder it appears.

text> This incredible snapshot from Europeâ€™s new Euclid space telescope is a
revolution for astronomy. The image shows 1000 galaxies belonging to the Perseus
Cluster, and more than 100 000 additional galaxies further away in the
background, each containing up to hundreds of billions of stars. Many of these
faint galaxies were previously unseen.
