text> This breathtaking image features Messier 78 (the central and brightest
region), a vibrant nursery of star formation enveloped in a shroud of
interstellar dust. This image is unprecedented – it is the first shot of this
young star-forming region at this width and depth. Euclid peered deep into this
enshrouded nursery using its infrared camera, exposing hidden regions of star
formation for the first time, mapping its complex filaments of gas and dust in
unprecedented detail, and uncovering newly formed stars and planets. This is the
first time we’ve been able to see these smaller, sub-stellar sized objects in
Messier 78; the dark clouds of gas and dust usually hide them from view, but
Euclid’s infrared ‘eyes’ can see through these obscuring clouds to explore
within.
